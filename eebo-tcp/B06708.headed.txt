The Worlds Wonder. Or, A strange and miraculous work of Gods providence, shewed to a poor distressed widdow and her seven small fatherl  children, who lived by a burnt six penny-loaf of bread, and a little water, for above seven weeks, in the wilde of Kent. To the Tune of, Chevy Chase.   TAke comfort Christians all, for never shall you sée, The faithful sort forsaken quite, and left in misery, Who lives and loves to hear, the truth in each degrée, The story of a Widdows plaint, let them give ear to mée. Who by this widdow here sufficient have béen try'd, The which was left both poor and bare when as her Husband dy'd. And seven young Children small, upon her hands likewise, And knew not how to buy them bread, their hunger to suffice. She labours night and day, she spins and takes great pain. And many a thing to buy them bread, God knows she layes to pawn, But when this help did fail, as time consumeth all, Oh! then she knew not how to kéep, her hungry Children small. Most Mighty God she said, cast down a tender eye, And suffer not thy servants here, in hunger for to dye. Thou that the Ravens did send, Elias  for to féed, When that he was in Wildernesse, in extream want and néed. And rained bread from Heaven, old  Israel  to preserve, And wouldst not in the Lyons den, let  Daniel  pine nor starve. I know my Lord she said, thou didst five thousand féed, With five small loaves of barly bread, as we in Scripture read. And each one had enough, their hunger to sustain, And afterwards twelve baskests full, of scraps did still remain, I know my Lord she said, thou art so mighty still, And therefore every thing be done, according to thy will. Her prayer ended thus, Her children cryed straight way, O mother dear give us some bread, we have eat none to day. Give mée some bread said one, give mee some bread said another, And thus the silly Infants flock, about their carefull mother. The good soul hearing this, perswades them to be still, O soon at night my Lambs quoth shee, you shall have bread your fill. I will to market go, though corn be wondrous dear, And sell my Gown to buy a peck, If you will be quiet here.   THe Children smil'd at this, content they did remain, Good Mother every one could say, come quickly home again. Three miles this woman went, unto the Market-town, And for five shillings at the last, she sold her russet Gown. Who being glad in heart, to Market streight she hies, But there alass her purse was cut, ere any corn she buyes, She cryeth out God wot, she weeps and makes great moan To every one that passeth by, her grief she makes it known. But yet behold and see here in her woeful case Her husbands brother he was one that sold corn in that place. This woeful Woman then, did him desire and pray. To trust her with one peck of corn, till the next market day. But he denyes her flat, And thus he tells her plain I shall not have to serve my turne, till corne doth come again. More heed you might have took, unto your purse quoth he, And not to lose your money here, so fond and foolishly. These dogged answers cut this good soul to the heart, Especially when she did think, upon her infants smart. Who sits and strives at home, poor souls but all in va e, Which of them should the highst péece, of bread and butter gain. But farre alass were they. from butter bread or chéese, Or any thing to comfort them that their poor Mother see's. But now behold Gods work, as homeward she return'd A baker's boy gave her a loaf which was in baking burn'd. She gave God thanks for that, and joyfull in her hand She bears the bread home to her babes which waiting for her stand. She kisses them each one, and with a chearful look And said we will to supper go when you have said your book. Mean time she makes a fire and apples therein throw, The widdow and her seven Children, to supper swéetly go. The apples rosted well, and she doth cut them bread, On every peece most lovingly she doth the Apple spread. Instead of drink they had, a cup of water clear, And every Childe rejoyced much and said, here is good chear. Behold when they had sup't, for God their food did blesse When they had sup't and were suffic'd, the loaf was never the lesse, For seven weeks spa e together as storys plainly spread, The Widdow and her seven children by this one loaf was fed. The Cut-purse-man I say, he broke his neck in  Kent, E're he of this poor Widdows Coyn, one single penny had spent, And yet behold and see, her husband's churlish brother, Which would not lend a peck of corn, to succor one or other, Had streight way after this, his corn clean wash't away, All by a mighty flood that rose, before the break of day. The Gentle men and such which did this wonder see. Vnto the Widdow gave such gifts, that never more wanted she, Take comfort Christians all, for never shall you see, The faithful sort forsaken quite, and left in misery. FINIS.
