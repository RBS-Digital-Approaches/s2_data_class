 Hic incipit fructus temporum. BYcause of these bokes made to tell what tyme of ony thy¯ge notable was. Therfore ye begy¯nynge of al tymes shortly shal be touched. For the whiche after doctours it is to be knowen / that foure thinges were made fyrst / & in one tyme & of one age / that is to wyte / the heuen imperyall / aungels nature / the matere of the foure elementes / & tyme. And that doctours call werke of the creacion / the whiche was made (afore ony daye or nyght) of ye myghty power of god / and was made of nothynge.  Than after foloweth ye werke of diuysyon / the whiche was made in thre of ye fyrst dayes / in whiche is shewed ye hygh wysdome of the maker.  Than after foloweth ye arayenge of this werke / in ye whiche is shewed the goodnes of the creatour / the whiche was made thre of ye nexte daye folowyng. Vt patet clare in textu gen¯ .j.  The fyrst daye god made & deuyded the lyght from the derknes.  The seconde daye god made & ordeyned the firmament / & diuyded the water from the water.  The thyrde daye god made in the whiche he gadered the waters in to one place / and the erth tho appered.  The fourth daye god made / in ye whiche daye he ordeyned ye sonne / the mone and the sterres / & put them in ye fyrmament.  The fyfth daye god made / in the whiche he ordeyned fysshes & foules / & grete whales in ye water.  The syxth daye god ordeyned / in the whiche he made beest & man.  The .vij. daye god made / & in yt day he rested of all werkes that he had ordeyned / not as in werkyng beynge wery / but he ceased to make mo newe creatures. Vide  pl’a  ge  .j.

IN the fyrst yere of ye worlde the syxth day god made and formed Adam in the felde da mastene / & Eua of his tybbes / puttyng them in paradyse / & bade them to kepe his commaundement / that they sholde not ete of ye fruyte of lyfe vnder the payne of deth. And ye same daye yt they had synned / anone he cast them out of paradyse in to ye lo¯de of cursednes that they sholde lyue there wt swerynge & sorowe tyll they dyed. Vide  pl’a  ge .  .  This Adam was an holy man all y• dayes of his lyfe / grete penan¯ce dayly he dyd. And he commaumded his chyldren to lyue ryghtwylly / & namely that they   sholde auoyde in all wyse from the company of Cayn & his chyldren. Nor that they shold not mary with none of them  This ma¯ Adam was our fyrst fader & for one synne put vs out of paradyse. But through his holy co¯uersacion & penaumce / he gaue vs ensample to come to the kyngdome of heuen. And he yt wyll not folowe his holy co¯uersacion & example for one synne / ryghtwysly he can not complayne on hym / as we doo many.  Seth sone to Adam was borne after the begynnynge of ye worlde .C. and. xxx yeres / & lyued .ix .C. and .xij. But Moyses ouerskypped an hondred of those / in the whiche Abel wepte in ye vale of ploracion nygh Ebron. This Seth for the oyle of mercy to be goten went to paradyse.  Delbora was syster to Abell. Abell was slayne of Cayn his broder. This Abell the fyrst martyr began the chirche of god. This man after Austyn made ye cite of god / & he was ye fyrst citezyn of yt cite. And bycause he was right wyse / our lorde receyued his offrynge.  Calmana was wyfe to Cayn. This Cayn was a cursed man / & he made the fyrst erthly cite that euer in this worlde was / in yt whiche he put his people for drede / in so moche as he vsed rauyne & violence. For he trusted suche thynge to be done to hym as he dyd to other / therfore he put hym and his in to a sure place. This man slewe his broder Abel for enuye / and he was punysshed of god / & wandred aboute in despayre. And was slayne of Lameth a blynde man.  Anno mumdi. iiij .C .xxxv.

Than they shall go forth for the comfortacyon of good men. And they shall be crowned wt the crowne of martyrdome. MAtusale of Chrystes lyne lyued ix .C .lxix. yere.

And he answered & sayd. For so lytell a tyme as .v. hondred yere I wyll buylde no hous. But rested vnder trees and hedges / and there slepte / as he was wont to do for a tyme.  Anno mundi. M. iiij .C .liiij. Et ante Christi natiuitate¯ .iij. M. vij .C .xlv. LAmeth was of the age of .vii. C lxxvij. yere. This Lameth was the first agaynst nature & good maners that ordeyned yt a man might haue two wyues in doynge his auoutry. And he was sore punisshed of the¯ / for they gaue hy¯ many a strype. For it is so yt by what thynge a man synned / by the same he is punysshed. This Lameth slewe Cayn not wylfully. But whan he was olde & blynde he was ladde of achylde ye whiche   trowed yt he had seen a wylde beest / & sayd to his mayster yt he shold shote / & so he slewe Cayn / wherfore for anger he slewe the chylde also.  And it is to be knowen that all craftes or scyences lyberal / or hande craftes / or of phisyke seruynge to ye curiosite of man / are redde yt they were foumden in the children of Lameth. And for they dradde the peryll to come of the flode & of the fyre. Therfore Tuball graued the same craftes in two pyllers / the one was of marble / & that other of tyle or brycke. Tubal foumde first the crafte to werke gold & syluer & yren. And was the fyrst grauer yt euer was.  Iabe foumde fyrst te¯toria for shepeherdes / & pauylyons for other men.  Iubal foumde fyrst ye crafte to playe vpon an harpe & organs / & other musycal instrumentes he vsed.  Noema founde fyrst the crafte for to weue lynnen & wollen cloth / & to drawe threde of woll & flaxe. And afore that tyme the people vsed the skynnes of beestes for theyr clothes.  Anno mundi. M. vj .C .xlij. Et ante Christi natiuitatem .iij. M .v .C. lvij. Here begynneth the seconde age of the worlde durynge to Abraham.   Noe. THe shyppe of Noe had in length iij .C. cubytes / in brede .l. in altytude .xxx. Vide  pl’a  gen¯ .vj.  Knowe ye after doctours / that a co¯uenyent payne this tyme was ordeyned to the worlde. For than lechery haboumded the whiche defouled mennes bodyes. And there by water ye erth was wasshed & clensed / in sygne of ye promesse yt god made to man that there sholde neuer be suche a flode agayne. And the Raynbowe hath two pry¯cypal colours / the whiche represent the two iudgementes. The water colour representeth ye flode that is passed. The fyre colour betokeneth the iudgement to come / & fyre the whiche we certaynly abyde in the ende of this worlde bycause couetyse shall haboumde / by fyre it shall be brente / as golde and syluer by the fyre is wonte to be clensed. THis Noe was a rightwyse man & foumde grace an nst god. Whan Noe was .v .c. yere of age he had goten Cham / Sem and Iaphet. That tyme by ye commaundement of god he began to make a shyppe / & he made it perfyte in an .C. yere / & the .C. yere complete our lorde appered agayne to hym & commaumded yt he wt his wyfe & his chyldren & ye wyues of them shold entre ye shyppe with all maner of beestes & al maner of foules also.  &c.  And anone ye flode came and stode aboue all hylles.  v. cubytes. Vide plura gen¯ .vij.  After the flode came grete dronkennes  e yd vnto Noe. And through the occasion of that dronke¯nes he blyssed his two sones Sem and Iaphet / for ye faders honour that they had to him / & for the honest shame that they couered mekely theyr faders membres whan he was slepynge. And his sone Cham for his scornynge & his vnreuerence he cursed.  And here after saynt Austyn is made ye fyrst mencyon of bondage / and of noblenes contrary to it. For Noe sayd that Cham sholde be seruaumt in bondage to Sem and Iaphet for his    ureuerence. Neuerthelesse ye shall not trowe that all that descended of Cham were vnnoble men / & of no power. For they began fyrst to be myghty men of ye erth. As it is open of Nemroth and the kynge of Chanaan & Astorum. Nor all of Sem & Iaphet were vertuous & noble & myghty men / whan almoost euerychone fell vnto ye cryme of ydolatrye / and were oftentymes oppressed of other men. But this blessynge and this cursynge hath a respecte to vertue & vyce / for yt whiche a man is called truly a noble man or an vnnobleman. For he that is vertuous is a noble man / and he that is vnuertuous is not noble. The same maner of wyse those that foloweth the faythe of Abraham rather were called his chyldren than the Iewes / the whiche carnally descended from hym. Neuertheles they had a spirytuall preuylege of god for the faders merytes and his blessynge. And of these thre sones of Noe he beynge alyue (after the hystory of Philoms) were borne .xxiiij. M. and an .C. men / without women and chyldren. And they had on them thre prynces / Nemroth / Iectan / and Sulphen.  Anno mundi .ij. M. ij .C .xlij. Et ante Christi natiuitate¯ .ij. M. vj .C .lvij. SEm sone to Noe the seconde yere after the flode gate Arphaxat / & otherwhyle he is called Melchisedech / the whiche fyrst after ye flode made the cite of Salem / & now is called Iherusalem.  Cham his broder obteyned Afffrica¯ / & gate two sones / Chus & Mesraym / & these two gate sones & doughters / and many a regyon they enhabyted vnknowen to vs in occidentall ynde.  Iaphet was broder vnto Cham / and was blyssed of his fader. And this Iaphet had seuen sones / as Gomor / Magog / Maday / Ianam / Tubal / Mosog / and Iras. And these .vij. gate sones & doughters / and of them came many a regyon. Vide plura genesis .xv.  Arphaxat soneto Sem lyued .CCC. and xxx. yere / and gate Elam / Assur / Lude / and Aram / & they gate many chyldren. Vt patet gene.  This Assur bycause he wolde not rebell agaynst god in the edyfyenge of the toure of Babylon / as Nemroth dyd / therfore he was dryuen vnto the londe of Sennaar londe / whiche was ryght straumge to hym / & was not before enhabyted / the whiche was called after his name Assuria / and there he edyfyed a cite afterwarde named Ni niue / the whiche was the metropolytane of all the kyngdome of Assuriorum.  Chus sone vnto Cham was fader to Nemroth / this Nemroth was a gyaumt of .x. cubytes longe / and he began to be myghty in ye worlde / and he is called a boystous hunter before god. This man began that wretched vyce of couetousnes by his tyranny / with yt whiche vice euermore after this worlde is fulfylled. And ye pryncypallest kyngdome that he had was Babylon / & he had Archade / Edyssa / Selencia / & the londe of Sennaar.  Sale sone to Arphaxat lyued CCCC. and .xxxiij. yere / and of hym in scripture is nothynge wryten / but that Moyses nombred hym in the lyne that cometh of Chryst. This Sale ga e a sone that was named Heber / the whiche after the Hebrewes had the spiryte of prophecye. And of this Heber the Hebrewes ben named. For the Hebrewes tongue abode alone in his hous in ye confusyon of the language. And that language was called ma¯nes language / the whiche euery man vsed afore the toure of Babylon was buylded.  This Heber had two sones / and one was called Iectan / and that other Phaleg. This   Iectan through ensample of Nemroth descendynge fro Cham toke the pryncehode vpon the children of Sem. And he had .xiij. sones. But these people after Ierome are not knowen of vs for fernes of the coumtree / or mutacyon and chaungynge of ye people / or elles of some other maner cause.  Anno mumdi .ij. M. vj .C .xliij. Et ante Christi natiuitatem .ij. M .v .C. lvj.  Turris Babilonis. Two hondred and .xxxix. yere lyued Phaleg. This Phaleg was the yonger sone of Heber / & in his dayes was made the confusyon of languages. For in his hous abode the olde tongue alone and that was hebrewe. Wherfore after saynt Austyn / in hym appered a grete stedfastnesse of ryghtwysnesse / for this hous was free of that payne / as not consentynge to the buyldynge of the toure. Et  scomm  Aug. there was .lxxij. generacyons / & so there were .lxxij. languages  Iectan broder to Phaleg of Sem / Nemroth prince of Cham / Sulphen of Iaphet / these thre prynces with theyr people gadered them togyder in ye felde of Sennaar / dredynge the flode to come agayn sayd. Let vs buylde a toure that shall reche to heuen.  &c.  Gene .xj. Our lorde seynge the folysshenes of ye people confounded theyr tongues for theyr synnes In so moche yt none vnderstode other / & so they were disperpled through all the worlde. Of ye malyce of this Nemroth bokes ben wryten full. And after ye confusyon of ye language he went to ye londe of Perce / and there he taught them to adoure the fyre as god. He lefte his sone Belus in Babylon / whiche succeded after hym. And so his progenye obtayned that realme after many yeres. In this tyme began many kyngdomes / & the moost of all those kyngdomes was the kyngdome of Scitarum. But there were so many rude people in it yt the cite was no worshipped / yet was it a myghty regyon of dystaumce. And about this tyme began ye kyngdome of Egypte the whiche was chaumged many tymes with dyuers alteracyons / & also it is spoken of many tymes in scripture.  Noblenes or gentylmen began about this sayd tyme And this noblenes or gentylmen was ordeyned for many causes.  The fyrst cause was necessite / for wham mankynde grewe sore / & men were prompte & redy to do hurt & domage to other / it was very necessary to wtstande ye grete malyce of ye cursed and wycked people agaynst good & ryghtwyse men. Therof a man is called gentylman or a noble man as before other in vertues notable. wherof saynt Ierom sayth. I se nothynge els in noblenes / or in gentylmen / but yt they are bounden in a certayne necessite yt they shall not recede fro the vertue / & the gen   tylnes of theyr noble aumcetours.  The seconde was ye dyuers worshyppyng of the people / for no man worshypped than but as his naturall reason gaue / & they knewe not veryly what they shold worship / for they were so dull of wytte that they coude pondre no grete thynge / but that was publysshed by the comyn people. Wherfore it was expedient for theyr peace to be kepte that they sholde haue prynces of noble byrthe.  The thyrde cause {pro}cedeth of some singuler strength Many tymes ye comynaltees were greued through ennemyes comynge vpon them & than they sayd yt who someuer wo¯lde defende them fro those perylles / he sholde haue the right of noblenes for hy¯m & for his heyres for euermore. And in this maner of wyse many are redde to be noble men.  The fourth cause of noblenes was haboundaumce of goodes. Somtyme ye people were holden with grete penury of meet & drynke / & than they toke them & theyrs to some ryche man / that through that couenaumt they sholde tempre ye grete straytnes of theyr honger / & after that they sholde knowe hym as theyr lorde & a noble man. Also there be foumde certayn noble men by the {pro}uysyon of god / though they were but fewe / of yt whiche som abode in vertue as Dauyd / & some fayled anone / as Saul and Ieroboam. And it is redde yt many were noble men by tyranny / of yt whiche some were destroyed anone / & some abode in stablenes / as paynyms myght.  Anno mundi .ij. M .ix. C .v. Et ante Christi natiuitate¯ .ij. M. ij .C .lxxxxiiij. S ruch lynially descended from our fore fader Adam to Abraham. And Nachor was his sone / & he lyued an .C. and .xlviij. yere. And aboute this tyme ydolatry began myghtely. And yf ye re uolue & loke ye hystoryes / ye shall fynde that thre thynges princypally brought men to ydolatry / that is to wyt  / the affeccyon that they had to deed men. Drede and flaterynge anenst theyr prynces. And the dylygence of crafty men about sculptures or grauynges. Wycked spirytes than entred in to ydolles and gaue answeres vnto the people / and these wycked spirytes confermed the errour of the people myghtely. In soo moche that who someuer wolde not conferme hym to theyr reason / he sholde greuously suffre the payne of dethe. Also there was added and put to these thynges / the deceyuynge laude and praysynge of poetes / the whiche wretches and dampned men in to heuen with theyr gaye wrytynges exalted. And that same tyme whan deuylles began to speke soo fayrly and so mekely to man / the good lorde of his grete mercy sente his aungelles / that they sholde speke vnto his electe men in vysyble maner / le st that all mankynde  shold  perysshe with that myscheuous erroure.  Belus sone to Nemroth this tyme was kynge of Babylon / & he was the fyrst kynge of this worlde. And this man was he whome the erroure of the people fyrste byleued sholde be a god. Wherfore dyuerse people named hym dyuersly / and some called hym Bell / some Baall / some Baalun / some Beelphagor / and some Beelsabub. And this vnhappy errour stode in mankynde more than two thousande yere.  Ninus sone to Belus the seconde kynge of Babylon or of Assuriorum regned .liiij. yere. And this Ninus desyred to haue lordshyp & worshyp / and to that entent that he myght be lorde of all the coumtree aboute hym / he gaue batayle to all that dwelled nye aboute hy¯. And bycause that tyme the people were rude / and had not the co¯nynge of fyghtyng   nor armure / anone he subdued vnto hym all As am. And there was made the fyrst Monarchye in ye eest part ye. And wham his herte was sory for ye deth of his fader Belus / he made to be made to hym for his comforte an ymage of his fader / vnto whome he gaue so myghty reuerence / yt what someuer gylty man had fledde to that ymage / there sholde no man do hym no hurte / & he pardoned him of al his trespace. And through his ensample many a man began to worshyp the deed ymage of theyr dere frendes. Than these malycyous spirytes seynge the curiosite of the people / hydde them within them / and gaue answeres vnto ye people & sayd they were goddes. And commaunded them to do reuerence to them as vnto goddes. Thus that vn happy synne of ydolatry was brought in / the whiche repugned myghtely to goddes mageste. And in so moche this madnes grewe / that he shold suffre the payne of deth that sayd they were men but goddes.  Anno mundi .iij. M .C .xiiij. Et ante Christi natiuitatem .ij. M .lxxxv.

ARam sone to Esrom of ye lyne of Chryst was about this tyme / & he gate Amynadab & Naason / of these men is lytel wryten in scripture & therfore I {pro}cede to other.  Iob ye holy ma¯ ensample of all pacience this tyme was borne of ye lyne of Nachor broder of Abraham / & he lyued many yeres / & after ye god had assayed hym in his pacience he lyued an .C. & .xl. yere ({per} Aug. gre. &  ) Moyses about this tyme was borne / & the children of Israel were in grete perplexite / & Moyses was put in ye water to be drowned. Aaron aboute this tyme was borne.  Dafrus was the.  . kyng of Babilon / & Moyses was borne vnder hym in Egypte.  C crops was the fyrste kynge of Athenes. And after saynt Austyn the Grekes wrote many lesynges in theyr storyes that tyme / for of a lytell thy¯ge they make a grete fame for to shewe theyr connynge for there was the vniuersite of Grekes.  Anno mundi .iij. M .vi. C .lxxviii. Et ante Christi natiuitate¯. M .v .C. x . THis time was Am nadab of christes lyne / sone to Aaron whiche after Moyses wt a full fayth entred in to the reed see / & dradde not wham many an C. were aferde lest they sholde haue ben drowned / & therfore he deserued to brynge forth ye kynges lygnage / of whome descended our lorde Iesu Chryst. Moyses was the fyrst iudge of Israel ye euer   was / and he was iudge .xl. yere. This Moyses was ye moost excellent {pro}phete that euer god made / & the moost notable wryter of storyes / & of his louynge heuen & erth speketh.

Eleazar was the seconde bysshop / & he & Iosue deuyded the loude of promyssyon to the children of Israel. Of hy¯ descended almoost all ye bysshops vnto Chryst.  Othonyel of ye trybe of Iuda was ye thyrde iudge / & this man delyuered ye children of israel by batayle from ye realme of Mesopotamye.

About this tyme ye kyng of ytalye began / & many tymes theyr names be chaumged / of yt whiche {pro}genye ye Romaynes shewe more clerely.  Ianas was ye first kyng in ytalye / & afterward of ye rude gentyles he was worshypped as god / faynynge hy¯ to haue two faces For they worshypped his feest in ye begy¯nynge of ye yere: as he were ye ende of the last yere / & ye begynnynge of ye fyrst.

And of Saturnus the Romayns were called Saturniam.  Picus was sone to Saturnus / & or he was kynge in ytalye he was kynge in Laurentyn / & after his decesse of the gentyles was worshypped for a god.

Iayr the .x. iudge of Israell had .xxx. sones / whome he made prynces of .xxx. cytees And bycause there were good men & ru led to ye pleasure of god. Therfore in the dayes of those two men / Israell drewe to our  lord  / & therfore all thynge came & was in prosperite & weith.

Sibilla delphis ca afore ye batayle of Troye prophecyed how a childe sholde be borne of a virgyn wtout manues seed.  Lamydon kyng of Troy was slayne and his doughter Eriona was taken in to Grekes londe. For yt whiche folowed myghty batayle & moost ferefull myscheues. Vide historiam troiana¯. Hercules with Iason destroyed Ilium or Troy / the whiche anone after was buylded of Priamus sone to Lamydon. This Hercules dyd many meruaylous thynges / & many myghty batayles / & infynyte lesynges ben fayned on hym.

Ebessam was iudge in Israel .vij. yere / & he was the .xij. iudge & he was named otherwyse Boos / the whiche wedded Ruth.  Abialon ye. xiij iudge of Israel was iudge .x. yere. And vnder these tymes ye chyldren of Israel were quyete / & therfore no notable thy¯ges were done in these dayes.  Abdon the .xiiij. iudge gouerned in Israel .viij. yere. And about this tyme ye hystory of Ruth was wryten.  Authamis this tyme was kyng of Assurio{rum}. And Priamus kynge of Troy sone to Laomedon buylded his cyte agayne meruaylously stronge / & began batayle wt the Grekes to his owne hurte / & he had a sone was called Hector a leyfull goten sone by his wyfe Eccuba. This man was faythful & wyse / & incomparable of strength & noblenes. This Priam{us} had an other sone that was called Paris / the whiche toke away fro ye lo¯de of Grekes Helena wyfe to Menelaus ye kyng.  Agamenon the kyng broder to Menelaus ye leder of al ye Grekes host faught agaynst Troy / & at the last he wanne ye cite falsly / & to ye gre kes moost shame & sclaumdre yt might be. For certaynly yt myght be called an vnhappy batayle where no man giueth lo uyng to ye Grekes / but euery man repor teth shame.  Eneas was kyng in yta lye .iij. yere. And this Eneas after that Troy was destroyed of ye Grekes came in to ytalye with .xx. shyppes / and dyd myghty batayles there. And this man had wedded Priam{us} doughter Elinsuram. And he was made a god through the errour of the comyn people / & of this man came Iulius cezar & Octauianus Augustus.  Vlixes an eloquent man amonge all the Grekes after many perylles on the see / went home to his Penelopem the moost faythful & the moost chaste woman that is redde of. And the Grekes perisshed wretchedly after that they had destroyed Troye bothe on the water and on the londe as they wente homewarde agayn. And that was the pryncypall date of theyr wrytynge after that vyctory. For they wrote theyr hystoryes and other wrytynges thus. Anno primo v  secumdo.  &c.  post Troiam captam.

But of him many tymes is made mencyon in holy scripture. For of hym descended Chryst our sauyour.  This tyme Hely was iudge & bisshop in israel the whiche had .ij. sones / Ophni & Phi nees / & for he corrected them not sufficiently / he & they were punisshed bothe of our lorde / for they were slayne of ye Philistie¯s / & Hely fell of his sete & brake his necke. This Hely was iudge next after Samson / & not of the lignage of Aron yt was fyrst bysshop of god electe / but of ythamar the lignage dured an .C. & .xx. yere / in yt whiche lignage Hely was the fyrst bysshop / & Abiathar the last. Vide plura .j. regum.

This Ascanius gate Siluius the .viij. kyng of ytaly / the whiche Siluius was fader vnto Brute kynge of Brytayn / now called Englonde. And I leue of the kynges of ytalye for they dyd but lytell noble thynges tyll it be co men to Romul{us} & Remus ye buylded Rome / & than shall those kynges come agayn. And now to {pro}cede to ye cronycles of Englonde / for yt whiche namely this boke is made.  Venys & Padua were buylded about this tyme of ye resydue of the Troyans.  Homere ye grete poete about this tyme was / yt whiche wrote & fayned gloryously many a lesynge.  Incipit regnum Britannie / nunc dicitur Anglia.  Here may ye se how Englonde fyrst began at Albyon.  Albyon.  Afore that I wyll speke of Brute it shall be shewed how the londe of englonde was fyrst named  byon & for what cause it was so named. IN the noble londe of Sirrie there was a noble kynge & myghty & a man of grete renome yt was called Dioclesyan that well & worthely hy¯ gouerned & ruled through his noble chyualry So yt he conquered all the londes about hym / so that almoost all ye kynges of the worlde to hy¯ were attendaumt. It befell thus yt this Dioclesian spoused a ge¯tyll damoysel yt was wonders fayre / yt was his vncles doughter Labana / & she loued hym as reason wolde / so yt he gate on her .xxxiij. doughters / of yt whiche ye eldest was called Albyne / and these damoyselles whan they came vnto age be came so fayre yt it was wonder / whereof Dioclesian anone let make a somnynge & commaunded by his lettres that all the kynges yt helde of hym sholde come at a certayn daye as in his lettres were conteyned to make a feest royal. At whiche daye thyder they came / & brought with them admyrats / princes / dukes & noble ch ualry. The feest was royally arayed and there they lyued in ioye and myrth ynough yt it was wonder to wyte. And it befell thus ye Dyoclesyan thought to mary his doughters amonge all those kynges yt were at ye solempnite. And so they spake & dyd that Albyne his eldest doughter & all her systers rychely were maryed to .xxxiij. kynges yt were lordes of grete honour at this solempnite. And whan this was done euery kynge toke his wyfe & ladde them in to theyr owne coumtre / & there made them quenes. And it befell thus afterward yt this dame Albine became so stoute & so sterne that she tolde lytel pryce of her lorde / & of hyy¯ had scorne & despyte / & wold not do his wyll but she wold haue her owne wyll in dyuers maters. And all her other systers euerychone bare them so euyll agaynst theyr lordes yt it was wonder to wyte. And for as moche yt them thought that theyr husbondes were not of so hye parentage comen as theyr fader. But those kynges yt were theyr lordes wold haue chastysed them with fayre maner vpon al loue & frendshyp yt they shold amende theyr euyll condicyons. But all was for nought / for they dyd theyr owne wyll in all thynge yt them lyked & had of power Wherfore those .xxxiij. kynges vpon a tyme & often tymes bette theyr wyues For they wende that they wold haueamended them & theyr tatches & wyckednes. But of suche condicions they were that for fayre speche & warnynge they dyd all ye worse / & for betynges eftsones moche the worse. Wherfore the kyng yt had wedded Albyne wrote the tatches and condicyons of his wyfe Albyne / & the lettre sent to Dyoclesyan her fader. And whan the other kynges herde that Albynes lorde had sente a lettre to Dioclesyan / anone they sente lettres sealed with theyr seales the condicyons & tatches of theyr wyues. Whan the kynge Dioclesyan sawe & herde so many complayntes of his doughters / he was sore ashamed and became wonderssy angry and wroth toward his doughters / and thought how he myght amende it that they so mysoyd / & anone sent his lettres to the .xxxiij. kynges yt they sholde come to hym / & brynge wt them theyr wyues euerychone at a certayn day / for he wolde there chastyse them of theyr wyckednes yf he myght in ony maner wyse. So that ye kynges came all at ye tyme & daye that tho was set bytwene hym and the kynges. Dioclesyan receyued them wt moche honour / & made a solem e feest vnto all that were vndernethe his lordshyp.   And the thyrde daye after that solempnite ye kynge Dioclesyan sent after his .xxxiij. doughters yt they shold come & speke with hym in his chambre. And wham they were come / he spake to them of theyr wyckednes & of theyr cruelte / & angerly them reproued & blamed & said to them. That yf they wolde not be chastysed / they sholde lose his loue for euermore. And whan ye ladyes herde al this they became abasshed & gretly ashamed & sayd to theyr fader yt they wolde make all amendes. And so they departed out of theyr faders chambre. And Albyne that was ye eldest syster ladde them all to her chambre / & tho made to voyde al yt were therin / so yt no psone was amonge them but she & her systers togyder. Thansayd this Albyne. My fayre systers / well we knowe yt the kyng our fader vs hath reproued / shamed & despysed / for bycause to make vs obedyent to our husbondes but certaynly yt shall I neuer whyles ye Ilyue / syth that I am come of a more hyer kynges blode than myn husbonde is. And whan she had thus said / all her systers sayd ye same. And than sayd Albyne. Well I wote fayre systers / yt our husbondes haue co¯playned vnto our fader vpon vs / wherfore he hath vs thus foule reproued & despysed / wherfore systers my coumseyle is yt this night whan our husbo¯des ben a bedde / all we wt one assent to kytte theyr throtes / & than we may be  peas of them / & better we may do this vnder our faders power than ony where els. And anone all ye ladyes consented & graumted to this counseyle. And whamnyght was comen / the lordes & ladyes went to bedde. And anone as theyr lordes were a ept / they kytte all theyr husbo¯des throtes / & so they shewe them all. Whan Dioclesian theyr fader herde of this thynge / he became wroth ryght furyously agaynst his doughters / & anone he wole them all haue brent. But all the harons & lordes of S rrye counseyled not so for to do suche straytnes to his owne doughters / but shold boyde ye londe of them for euermore / so that they neuer sholde come agayne / & so he dyd. And Dioclesyan yt was theyr fader anone commaumded them to go in to a shyppe / & delyuered to them  itayles for halfe a yere. And whan this was done / all the systers wente in to the shyppe & sayled forth in ye see / & betoke all theyr frendes to Appolyn yt was theyr god & so longe they sayled in the see  yll at the last they came & arryued in an yle yt was all wyldernes. And whan dame  yne was come to ye londe & all her systers this  byne went fyrst forth out of ye shyppe & sayd to her other systers. For as moche as I am ye eldest syster of all this company / & first this londe haue take / & for as moche as my name is Alb ne / I wyl   this londe be called Albion after my  owne name. And anone all her systers graumted to her with a good wyll. Than went out of ye shyppe all ye systers & toke the londe Albion as theyr syster called it & there they went vp & downe & foumde neyther man ne woman ne chylde but wylde beestes of dyuers kyndes. And whan theyr  ttayles were dispruded & sayled / they fedde them with herbes & fruytes in season of yt yere / & so they  ued as they best myght / & after yt they toke flesshe of dyuers beestes & bera  wonders fa e / & so they desyred ma¯nes company / & ma¯nes kynde them fay ed. And for here they wexed wonders couragyous of kynde / so that they desyred more mannes company than ony other solace or myrth. Whan the deuyll yt per yued went by dyuers countries & toke a body of ye ayre / & lykyng natures sh  of men / & came in to ye londe of Albion / & lay by those women & shad tho natures   vpon them / & they conceyued & brought forth gyaumtes. Of whiche one was called Gogmagog / & another Langerigan And so they were named by dyuers names / & in this maner they came forth & were borne horryble gyaumtes in Albion And they dwelled in caues & in hylles at theyr wyll / & had the londe of Albion as them lyked / vnto ye tyme that Brute arryued & came to Totnes yt was in the yle of Albion / & there this Brute conquered & disco¯fyted ye gyaumtes aboue sayd.  Explicit prima pars.  Here begy¯neth now how Brute was goten / & how he slewe fyrst his moder / & after his fader. And how he conquered Albyon / that after he named Brytayne after his owne name / that now is called Englonde / after the name of Engyst of Saxonye. This Brute came in to Brytayne aboute the .xviij. yere of Hely. BE it knowen that in ye noble cite of grete Troy there was a noble knyght and a man of grete power that was called Eneas. And whan ye cite of Troy was lost & destroyed through them of Grece. This Eneas with all his meyny fledde thens & came in to Lombardy. And tho was lorde & gouernour of that londe a kyng that hyght Latyne. And another kynge there was ye hyght Turocelyne that strongly warred vpon this kynge Latyne / ye oftentymes dyd hym moche harme. And whan this kynge Latyne herde yt Eneas was come / he receyued hym with moche honour / & hym with helde for as moche as he had herd of hy¯ and wyst well yt he was a noble knight and a worthy of his body & of his dedes This Eneas helped kynge Latyne in his wa  / & shortly for to tell / so well & so worthely he dyd / that he slewe Turocelyne / & dyscomfyted hym & all his people. And whan all this was done / kyng Latyne gaue all ye londe that was Turocelynes to this noble man Eneas i  maryage with Lauyne his doughter the moost fayrest creature that ony man wyst. And so they lyued togyder in ioye and myrth all the dayes of theyr lyues.  And after Ascanius sone to Eneas wedded a wyfe / and vpon her he gate a sone that was called Siluine. And this Siluyne whan he coude some reason of man vnwytyng his fader and agaynst his wyll acqueynted hym wt a damoysel that was cosyn to Lauyne that was kynge Latynes doughter ye quene that was Eneas wyfe / and brought the damoysell with chylde. And whan Ascanius his fader it wyst / anone let enquyre of the wysest maysters and of the gretest clerkes what chylde the damoysell sholde brynge forth. And they answered and sayd / that she sholde brynge forth a sone that shold kyll bothe his fader and his moder. And so he dyd. For his moder dyed in berynge of hym. And whan this chylde was borne his fader let call hym Brute. And ye maysters sayd that he sholde do moche harme and sorowe in many dyuerse places / and after he sholde come to grete honour and worshyp. This kyng Ascanius dyed whan god wolde / and Siluyne his sone receyued the londe / and made hym wonder ly well beloued among his people. And so wham Brute that was Siluynes sone was .xv. yere olde he went vpon a daye with his fader for to playe & solace. And as Brute shold haue shotte vnto an hart his arowe myshapped & glanced / and so there Brute slewe his fader.  How Brute was dryuen out of the londe / & how he helde hym in Grece.  ANd whan this mischaumce was befallen / all ye people of the londe made grete sorowe / and were sore dyspleased. And bycause therof they droue Brute out of ye londe / & wolde not suffre hym amonge them. And whan he sawe that he might not abyde there / he went from thens in to Grece / & there he foumde vij. thousande men that were of ye kynrede of Troye / and were comen of grete blode as the story telleth / as of men and women & children / the whiche were all holden in thraldome & bondage of kyng Pandras of Grece / for ye deth of Achylles that was betrayed & slayne at Troy This Brute was a wonders fayre man and a stronge & huge of his age / and of gladde chere & semblaumt / & also worthy of body / & was well beloued amo¯ge his people. This kyng Pandras herde speke of his goodnes & condicyons / & anone made hym to dwell with hym. So that Brute became wonders preuy & moche beloued with ye kynge / & dwelled longe tyme with the kynge. So at ye last they of Troy & Brute spake togyder of kynrede & lygnage & of acqueyntaumce / and there complayned them vnto Brute of theyr sorowe & of theyr bondage / and of many other shames ye kynge Pandras had done to them / & to Brute they sayd vpon a tyme. Ye be a lord of our lignage & a stronge man & a myghty / be ye our capytayne & gouernour / & we wyll become your men / & fulfyll al your commaum dementes / & brynge vs out of this wret chednes & bondage / & we wyll fyght wt the kyng for trouth / with the grace of ye grete god we shall ouercome hym & we shall make you kynge of this londe / & to you do homage / & of you we shall holde for euermore. Brute had tho grete pyte of theyr bondage yt they were brought in / & pryuely went fro ye kynges courte / and tho that were of Troy went & put them in to woodes & in to mountaynes / & helde them there / and sente vnto kynge Pandras that he sholde gyue them lycence for to departe safely out of his lo¯de and kyngdom / for they wolde no longer dwell in his bondage. Whan kyng Pandras herde this / he was sore vexed and anoyed / & tho sware that he wolde  e them euerychone / and ordeyned a grete power / and went towardes them for to fyght with them. But Brute and his men manly them defended and fyersly fought / & slewe all the kynges men that none of them escaped / and toke ye kynge and put hym in pryson / and ordeyned a coumseyle amonge them selfe what they myght do wt the kynge. And some sayd that he sholde be put to deth / and some sayd that he sholde be exyled out of the londe / & some sayd yt he sholde be brent. And than spake a wyse knyght yt was called Mempris & sayd to Brute & to all them of Troy. Yf kyng Pandras wolde yelde hym & haue his lyfe / I coumseyle yt he gyue vnto Brute (that is our duke & our souerayn) his doughter Ge og  to wyfe / & in maryage with her an hondred shyppes well arayed / & all his treasour of golde & syluer / of corne & of wyne and as moche as we nede of one thynge & other / & than go we out of this londe and ordeyne vs a lo¯de els where / for we nor none of our kynrede yt come after vs shall neuer haue peas in this londe amonge them of Grece / for we haue  ayne so many of theyr knyghtes & of other frendes that euermore warre & dyscord shall be amonge vs. Brute tho & all his folke consented gladly to ye coumseyle / and this thy¯ge they tolde to kyng Pandras And he for to haue his lyfe / graumted as moche as they demaunded / and anone gaue vnto Brute the fayre lady Gennogen his doughter to wyfe / and an hondred shyppes with as moche as them     of all vytayles / as afore was ordeyned. Than Brute toke his wyfe & all his men that forsoke the londe of Grete & went to the see / & had wynde & weder at theyr wyll / & came the thyrde daye in to an yle that was called Logres. This Brute anone sent of his men to londe for to espye ye maner of ye coumtrce. And they founde an olde cite all wasted & forlet / so that there was neyther man nor woman therin dwellynge. And in the myddle of this cyte they foumde an olde temple of a fayre lady that was called Diane the goddesse. And they came agayne vnto Brute & tolde hym what they had seen & foumde / & they coumseyled hym to go & do sacrifyce vnto dame Diane / for she was wont to gyue answere of what thynge that men asked her / & namely vnto them that honour her with sacryfyce. Brute wente vnto yt ymage & sayd. Diane noble goddesse that all thynge hast in thy myght / wyndes / waters / woodes / feldes / & all thynges of ye worlde / & all maner of beestes that ben therin / vnto you I make my prayer / that ye coumseyle me and tell / where & in what pla¯ce I shall haue a co¯uenyent place to dwell in with my folke. And there I shall make in the honour of the a fayre temple & a noble / wherin ye shall alwaye be honoured. Whan he had done his prayer / Diane answered in this maner. Brute sayd she go euen forth thy way ouet the see in to fraumce towarde the west / & there ye shal fynde an yle that is called Albion / & that yle is becompassed all with the see / & no man may come therin but it be by shyppes / & in that londe were wont to dwell gyauntes / but now it is not so / but all wyldernes / & that londe is destenyed & ordeyned for you & for your people.  How Coryn became Brutes man / & how kynge Goffar was discomfyted. ANd whan Brute had this answere of Diane the goddesse / anone he let wy¯de vp the ancres & sayled in to the hye see. And wham he & his men had sayled .xx. dayes & more / they foumde fall besyde a coost of the see a. M. men of the kynrede of Troy / & theyr souerayne mayster was called Coryn. And whan Brute wyst whens they were / he toke them wt moche ioye in to his shyppes / & so he ladde them forth with hym. This Coryn there became Brutes man / & to hy¯ dyd homage. And so lo¯ge they sayled forth in the see tyll they came in to Gascoyne / & anone they arryued in ye hauen of Lyegers / & there they dwelled .viij. dayes for to rest them / and to amende theyr sayles there as they had nede. Ty dynges soone came to kyng Goffar that was  lord  of that londe how that moche people of straunge londe were arryued in to his londe in the hauen of Lyegers wherfore he was sore angred & anoyed that they came and arriued in his londe without his lycence & his leue. And anone ordeyned hym a grete power for to dryue out Brute & to destroye hym & all his people. But it was so ye kynge Goffar was dyscomfyted & all his people / & hymselfe fledde in to fraunce for to haue helpe & socour. And in yt tyme regned in fraunce .xij. kynges / and .xj. of them assembled a grete power for to belpe Goffar / & for to fyght agaynst Brute. This Goffar dwelled wt the kynges of fraumce halfe a yere & more. And in the meane tyme that Goffar was in fraumce / Brute & his company destroyed all the londe of Gascoyne / and let take all the treasour that kynge Goffar had / & made it to be brought in to his shyppes.  And this Brute foumde in that londe a fayre place and a conueny ent / & there he let make a fayre castell and a stronge. Whan this was all done / kynge Goffar came from   fraunce and .xj. kynges with hym / and brought wt hym .xx. M. men for to fyght with Brute & his company. And Brute had but .vij. M. and .iij. C. men / & neuer theles whan ye two hoostes mette togyder / Brutes folke through helpe of hym selfe & of Turyn his cosyn & of Coryn / y• well & manly him defended / so y• within a whyle they had slayne of y• frenshmen moo than two. M. Anone all tho y• were alyue fledde away. And in this batayle Turin Brutes cosyn was slayne / & Brute let bury hym worthely whan he had space in ye castell yt he had made / & tho let call yt same castell Tours / for bycause of the name of Turin yt there was buryed And yet vnto this daye there is a noble cite yt is called Tours. And whan kyng Goffar wyst yt Turyn was deed / he came agayne wt his men & gaue a stronge batayle to Brute. But Brute & his men were so wery for fighty¯ge yt they might no longer endure / & than went in to his castel wt all his men: & made y• gates fast for to saue them / & toke coumseyle amo¯ge them what they sholde do. Brute & Coryn gaue coumseyle & ordeyned pryuely y• Coryn shold go out and busshe hym in a wode tyll on y• morowe / so yt in the mornynge whan Brute sholde fyght wt his enemyes / Coryn shold come wt his folke on ye one syde & slee & do all ye harme yt he myght. And on the morowe at the dawnynge of y• daye Brute wente out of the castel & fought fyersly wt his enemyes / & they manly defended them. But within a lytell tyme Brumte & his men slewe. viij hondred of kynge Goffers men / & than came Corin wt the busshement / & he & his company smote to the groumde all those y• wolde stande or abyde / so ye kynge Goffar & his company were discomfyted / & fast they began to flec. And Brute & Coryn with theyr company fyersly them pursued / and slewe moo of them in the fleynge than they dyd in y• batayle. And in this maner Brute had y• victory / neuertheles Brute made moche sorow for his cosyn Turyn that there was slayne & other also that he had lost of his men / that is to saye .vij. hondred and .xv. the whiche nobly he buryed in the same castell of Tours / there where that he had buryed Turyn his cosyn.  How Brute arryued at Totnes in the yle than called Albyon / and of the wrastlyng that was bytwene Coryn and Gogmagog.   ANd wham all this was done Brute wold no longer dwell there for to fyght & lose his men. For kyng Goffers people myght euery day encrease moo and moo / & Brutes men lessed / & therfore he toke all his men & wente vnto the see / & had wynde & weder at theyr wyll. And the fyfth daye after they arryued in an hauen at Cornes / & came in to this realme yt than was called Albyon / where they founde neyther man nor woman / saue grete gyauntes / & they dwelled in mountaynes & in cauernes. And Brute   sawe the londe was fayre and at his ly kynge / and was good also for hym & for all his people / as Diane ye goddesse had behyght hym. And therof was Brute wonders gladde / and let assemble vpon a daye all his folke to make a solempne sacrifyce and a grete feest in ye honour & reuere¯ce of Diane the goddesse / whiche had coumseyled hy¯ fyrst to come in to this londe. And wham they had done theyr sole¯ pnite / as they sate at theyr meet vpon a daye there came in vpon them .xxx. gyauntes / and slewe .xxx. of Brutes men. Brute & his men anone stert vp & fought with the gyauntes / & slewe them euerychone / saue one yt was called Gogmagog / & he was mayster of all y• gyaumtes & he was stronger & hyer than ony of the other / & Brute kepte hym for to wrastle with Corin his man / for he was greter and hyer than  ny of Brutes men from the gyrdelstede vpwarde. Gogmagog & Corin vndertoke there for to wrastle / & so togyder they went / & wrastled a lo¯ge tyme / but at the last Gogmagog helde Coryn so fast yt he brake two rybbes in his syde / wherfore Coryn was sore angry / & there he toke Gogmagog bytwene his armes & cast hym downe vpon a roche / soo that Gogmagog brake all to peces / & so he dyed an euyll deth / & therfore the place is called yet vnto this day the saute of Gogmagog. And than after Brute gaue all that coumtree vnto Corin And than Corin called it after his name Cornewayle / & his men ben called Cornewayles / & so sholde men of that countree be called for euermore. And in that countree dwelled Corin & his men / and they made townes and houses / & euhabyted that londe by theyr owne wyll.  How Brute buylded London / & called this londe Brytayn / and Scotlonde Albanye / and Wales Cambar.  London. BRute & his men wente forth and sawe aboute in dyuerse places where yt they myght fynde a good place and couenable that they myght buylde and make a cyte on / for hym and for his folke. And so at the last they came by a fayre ryuer / whiche now is called Temmes / and there Brute began to buylde a fayre cyte / and called it newe Troye / in remembraunce of grete Troye / from the whiche place all theyr lygnage was comen. And this Brute let fell downe wodes / & let ere & sowe londes / & let mawe down medowes for ye sustenaumce of hy¯ & his people. And than he departed ye londe to them / so yt eche of them had a parte & place to dwell in. And than Brute let call all this londe Brytayne after his name and his folke Brytons. And this Brute had gote¯ on his wyfe Gennogen .iij. sones yt were worthy of dedes / ye first was called Lotryn / ye seconde Albanak / & the   thyrde Cambar / & Brute bare crowne in the cite of newe Troy .xx. yere after y• tyme that ye cyte was made. And there he made the lawes yt the Britons holde And this Brute was wondersly well be ioued amonge all his people. And Brutes sones also loued wondersly well togyder. And whan Brute had sought all the londe in length & brede / he founde a londe yt ioyned to Brytayne in the north And that londe Brute gaue to Albanak his sone / & let call it Albanye after his name / yt now is called Scotlonde. And Brute foumde an other countree to warde the west / and gaue that to Cambar his other sone / & let call it Cambar after his name / and now it is called Wales. And whan Brute had regned .xx. yere / than he dyed in the cite of newe Troye.  How Lotryn that was Brutes sone entred with moche honour / and gouerned the londe well and worthely. AFter Brute regned Lotryn his sone / that was ye seconde kynge in Brytayn. And he began to regne the seconde yere of Samuel. This Lotryn was crowned kyng wt grete solempnite of all Brytayne: And after wham he was crowned kyng / Albanak & Cambar his bretherne departed in to theyr owne coumtrees / & there they lyued with moche honour and worshyp. And Lotryn regned well & wysely / & was moche beloued of his people. And it befell so yt as Albanak dwelled in his his owne londe wt moche honour & worship / there came kyng Hum bar of Hunlonde with a grete power / &  ryued in Albanye / & wold haue co¯que  the londe / and began to warre vpon Albanak / slowe hy¯ in batayle. Whan Albanak was deed / the people of ye lo¯de fledde vnto Lotryn & tolde him bycause he was kynge of Brytayne how yt his broder was slayne / & prayed hym of his helpe & socour for to auenge his broders deth. Lotryn than anone let assemble all the Brytons of Kent / of Douer vnto derewent / of Norfolke & Suffolke / of Keft fen & Lyndessey. And whan they were assembled / they sped them fast towarde theyr enemyes for to gyue them batayle And Lotryn had sente to Cambar his broder yt he sholde come vnto hym with all ye power that he myght make / for to helpe hym to auenge his broders deth. And so he dyd with a good wyll. Whan they came togider they toke theyr waye pryuely for to go seke kynge Humbar where they myght fynde hym. And so it befell that this kynge Humbar was besyde a water that was a grete ryuer with his folke for to dysporte hym. And there came Lotryn & Cambar his broder with all theyr folke sodeynly or that ony of theyr enemyes wyst. And whan Humbar sawe them come / he was sore adrad / for as moche as his men wyst   not afore / and also they were vnarmed. And anone Humbar for drede   in to the water and drowned hymselfe / and so he dyed / and his men were all flayne in so moche that there escaped not one awaye on lyue. And therfore is that water called Humbar / and euermore shall be as longe as the worlde standeth / for bycause that this kynge Humbar was drowned therin. And after that Locryn went to his shyppes & toke there golde and syluer as moche as he founde vnto himselfe / & all that other pylfre be gaue vnto other folke of his hoost. And they founde in one of the shyppes a fayre damoyfell whiche was kynge Humbars doughter / and she was called Estrylde. And whan kynge Lotryn sawe her / he toke her with hym bycause of the grete beaute and fayrnes that he sawe in her And for her he was ouertaken in loue /    and wolde haue wedded her. These tydynges came to Corin: & anone thought to auenge hym on Lotryn / for as moche as Lotryn had promised hym to wedde Guentolyn his doughter. And Corin in haste toke his waye to newe Troy vnto hym / & sayd thus to Lotryn. Certes ye rewarde me full euyll for ye paynes that I haue had for your fader Brute / wher fore syth it is so I wyll auenge me now on the. And with yt drewe his swerde & wolde haue slayne Lotryn ye kyng. But the damoysel went bytwene them / and made them to be accorded in this maner that Lotryn sholde take Guentolyn Corins doughter to wyfe. And so Lotryn dyd. Neuertheles after he was maryed he wente pryuely to Estrylde & gate on her a doughter that was called Abram And it befell so yt anone after Corin dyed & after whan he was deed / Lotryn forsoke Guentolyn that was his wyfe / & made Es  quene. And than Guentolyn dep  from the s   grete wrath in to Cori e / & there seased all the londe in to her owne ha ors / for as moche as she was her faders heyre / & toke homage of all y• men of y• londe. And afterwarde she assembled a grete hoost & a myghty of men for to be auenged vpon Lottyn y• was her lorde / & gaue hym a stronge but a yle / where Lotryn her husbonde was slayne / & his men disco¯fyted in the .v. yere of his regne. Gue¯tolyn let take Estrylde & Abram her doughter / & bounde them bothe handes & fete & cast them bothe in to a water / & so they were dro ed / wherfore y• water was euermore after called Abram / after y• name of y• damoysell y• was Est yldes doughter / & englysshe men call that water Seuerine / & walshmen call it Abram yet vn to this daye. And whan this was done Gu ol yn let crowne her quene of all y• londe. And she gouerned the londe well and wysely vnto th ty me that   her sone that Lotryn had goten   was .xx. yere of age / that he myght be kyng. And so the quene reg d .xv. yere And than let she crowne her sone kyng / and he regned and gouerned the   well & worthtly. And his moder went in to Cornewayle / and there she dwelled all the dayes of her lyfe.  How Madan reg ed in peas all his lyfe. THis Madan sone to Lotryn regned on the Brytons .xl. yere / the whiche began to regne the .xv. yere of Saul. And this Madan lyued in peas all his dayes / & gate two sones / Mempris and Maulyn.

Of kynge Leyr sone to Bladud / & of the answere of his yongest doughter / that gracyously was maryed vnto the kynge of fraunce. AFter kyng Bladud regned Leyr his sone / and this Leyr made y• towne of Leycestre / & he let call y• towne after his name / & he gouerned y• towne well & nobly. This kyng Leyr had thre doughters / y• fyrst was called Gonorill / the seconde Rigan / & y• thyrde Cordeill / and the youngest doughter was fayrest & best of co¯dicyons. The kyng theyr fader became an olde man / & wolde yt his doughters were maryed or y• he dyed / but fyrst he thought to assay whiche of them loued him moost & best / for she y• loued him best sholde best be maryed. And he axed of y• first doughter how well she loued hy¯. And she answered & sayd / better than her owne lyf. Now certes sayd her fader / y• is a grete loue. Than he axed the seconde doughter / how moche she loued hym. And she sayd more & passynge all y• creatures of y• worlde. Per ma foy sayd her fader / I may no more axe. And than he axed of y• thyrde doughter how moche she loued him. Certes fader sayd she / my systers haue tolde you glosyng wordes / but I shall tell you trouth / for I loue you as I ought to loue my fader And for to brynge you more in certayne how I loue you I shall you tell / as moche as ye be worth / so moche shall ye be loued. The kyng her fader wende y• she had scorned hym / and became wonders wroth / & sware by heue¯ & erth she  shold  neuer haue good of him / but his doughters y• loued hym so moche shold be well auaumced & maried. And y• first doughter he maryed to Maugles kynge of Scotlonde / & the seconde he maryed to Hauemos erle of Cornewayle / & so they ordeyned & spake bytwene them y• they sholde departe y• realme bytwene them two after y• deth of kyng Leyr theyr fader / so y• Cordeill his yongest doughter sholde no thynge haue of his londe. But this Cordeill was wonders fayre & of good co¯dicyons & maners / that y• kynge of fraumce Aga¯pe herde of her fame / & sent to kyng Leyr her fader for to haue her vnto his wyfe / & prayed hym therof. And kynge Leyr her fader sent him worde y• he had departed his londe & gyue¯ all to his two doughters before said / & sayd he had no more lond wherwith her to mary. And whan Agampe y• kynge of fraumce herde this answere / he sente anone agayne to Leyr & sayd y• he asked no thynge wt her but onely her clothinge & her body. And anone kyng Leyr sent her ouer y• see to y• kynge of fraumce. And he receyued her wt moche worship / & wt solempnite he spoused her / & made her quene of fraumce.  How kyng Leyr was dryuen out of his londe through his folke. And how Cordeill his yongest doughter helped hym at his nede. THus it befell afterwarde y• these two eldest doughters wolde not abyde tyll Leyr theyr fader was deed /    but warred vpon hym whyles that he was on lyue / & dyd hym moche sorow & shame / wherfore they toke from hym all ye realme / & bytwene them had ordeyned yt one of them shold haue kyng Leyr to soiourne all his lyfe tyme wt .lx. knyghtes & squyers / yt he myght worshypfully go & ryde wheder yt he wolde / & in to what coumtree yt hym lyked to playe & to solace. So yt Maugles kyng of  Scotlond  had kyng Leyr with hym in ye maner as is aboue sayd / & or a yere was passed Gonoril yt was his eldest doughter & quene of Scotlond was so anoyed of hym & of his people / yt anone she & her lorde spake togyder / wherfore halfe his knyghtes & his squyers went from hym / & no more were lefte wt hym but .xxx. And whan this was done Leyr began for to make moche sorow for bycause that his estate was empayred / & men had of him more scorne & despyte than euer they had before / wherfore he wyst not what to do. And at y• last thought y• he wold go in to Corne wayle to Rigan his other doughter. And wham he was come y• erle & his wyfe that was Leyrs doughter welcomed hym / & wt hym made moche ioye / & there he dwelled with .xxx. knyghtes & squyers. And he had not scarsly dwelled there a yere but yt his doughter of hym & of his company was wery / & her lord & she of hym had grete scorne & despyte / so that from .xxx. knyghtes they brought vnto .x. and afterwarde had he but .v. & so they left hym no moo. Than made he grete sorowe / & sayd sore wepyng. Alas that euer I came in to this londe & sayd yet had it ben better to haue dwelled wt my fyrst doughter. And anone he went thens to his fyrst doughter agayn / but anone as she sawe hym come she sware by god & by his holy name / & by as moche as she myght that he  shold  haue no more wt hym but one knyght yf he wold there abyde. Than began Leyr agayne to wepe and made moche sorowe & sayd Alas now to longe haue I lyued yt this sorowe & myschefe is to me now fallen. For now am I poore yt somtyme was ryche / but now haue I no frende ne kyn that to me wyll do ony good. But wham I was ryche all men me honoured & worshypped / & now euery man hath of me scorne & despite / & now I wote wel that Cordeil my yongest doughter said trouth wham she sayd / as moche as I had so moche sholde I be loued / & all y• whyle yt I had good / so lo¯ge was I loued & honoured for my rychesse / but my two doughters glosed me tho / & now of me they set lytel pryce / & sothe tolde me Cordeil but I wolde not byleue it ne vnder stande & therfore I let her go fro me as a thinge that I set lytell pryce of / & now wote I not what to do syth my two doughters haue me thus deceyued yt I so moche loued / & now must I nedes seke her yt is in an other londe yt lyghtly I let go  o me wtout ony reward or gyftes and s e sayd that she loued me as moche as she ought to loue her fader by all maner of reason / & than I sholde haue a d her no more / & those yt me other wyse beb ght through theyr fals speche now haue me deceyued. In this maner Leyr   tyme began to make his mo e. And at the last he shope hym to ye see / & passed ouer into fraumce / & asked & espyed where the quene myght be founde. And men tolde hym where she was. And wham be came to ye cite that she was in pryuely he sene his squyer vnto ye quene to tell her yt her fader was comen to her for grete nede. And whan ye squyer came to ye quene he told her euery dele of her systers from ye begynnynge vnto the ende. Cordeil the quene anone toke gold & syluer plente & toke it to ye squyer in coumseyle yt he sholde go in to a certayne cite and hym araye &   wasshe / & than come agayn to her / and brynge with him an honest company of knyghtes .xl. at the leest wt theyr meyny and than he sholde sende to her lorde the kynge & feyne that he were comen for to se & speke with his doughter & hy¯. And so he dyd. And whan the kynge and the quene herde that they came / with moche honour they hym receyued. And the kynge of fraumce than let sende through all his realme & commaumded that all men sholde be as entendaumt to kynge Leyr y• quenes fader in all maner of thinges as it were vnto hymselfe. Wham kyng Leyr had dwelled there a moneth & more he tolde to y• kynge & to y• quene his doughter how his two eldest doughters had serued hym. Agampe anone let ordeyne a grete host of frenshmen & sent in to Britayne wt Leyr y• quenes fader for to conquere his kyngdome agayne. And Cordeil also came wt her fader in to Britayn for to haue the realme after her faders deth. And anone they went to shyppe & passed the see & came in to Brytayne / & fought wt the felons / & discomfited them & slewe / & than had he his londe agayn / & after lyued thre yere & helde his realme in peas / & afterward dyed. And Cordeil his doughter him let bury with moche honour at Leycestre.  Anno mumdi .iiij. M. iij .C .xlix. Et ante Christi natiuitatem. viij .C .liij.

WHan that kyng Leyr was deed Cordeill his yongest doughter regned y• .x. yere of Ozias kyng of the Iewry. And after her regned Conedag / the .xv. yere of Ozias. And Cordeill that was Leyrs yongest doughter after the deth of her fader had al y• londe fyue yere / & in the meane tyme dyed her lorde Agampe y• was kyng of fraunce. And after his deth there came Morgan & Conedag that were Cordeyls systers sones & to her had enemite for as moche as theyr aunt had y• londe / so y• bytwene them they ordeyned a grete power / and strongly warred on her / & neuer rested tyll they had taken her & put her to deth And than Morgan & Conedag seased al the londe & departed it bytwene them / & they held it .xij. yere / & whan y• .xij. yere were gone there began bytwene them a grete debate / so y• they warred strongly togyder / & dyd to eche other moche dysease / for Morgan  wold  haue all y• londe fro beyonde Humber y• Conedag helde. But he came agaynst hym wt a stronge power: so y• Morgan durst not abyde but fledde away in to Wales / and Conedag pursued hym / & toke hym & slewe hym. And than Conedag came & seased al the londe in to his handes & helde it / & regned after .xxxiij. yere / & than he dyed / & lyeth at newe Troy.  And bycause y• mater co¯teyneth most commodiously togyder of y• kynges of Britayn now called Englonde / for y• tyme of them is not certaynly knowen what tyme of y• worlde these kynges folowynge regned / therfore they shall be togyder tyll it be comen vnto Euentolyn kyng of Brytayne now called Englonde.

How Gorbodian regned in peas that was Reynoldes sone. AFter this Reynolde regned Gorbodian his sone .xv. yere / & than dyed / and lyeth at Yorke.  How Gorbodian had .ij. sones / & how the one slewe y• other for to haue y• londe / & how ydoyne theyr moder slew y• other wherfore the londe was destroyed. WHan this Gorbodian was deed his two sones y• he had became stoute & proude / & euer warred togyder for the londe / & y• one was called Ferres & y• other Porres. And this Ferres wolde haue all y• londe / but that other wold not suffre hym. This Ferres had a felonous hert: & thought through treason to slee his broder / but pryuely he wente in to fraumce / & there abode wt the kynge Syward / tyll vpon a tyme whan he came agayn to fyght wt his broder Ferres but full euyl it happed him / for he was slayne fyrst. Whan ydoyne theyr moder wyst that Porres was deed she made grete sorowe / for bycause y• she loued hy¯ more than y• other / & thought for to slee hym pryuely. And pryuely she came to her sone vpon a night wt two knyues & therwt cut his throte / & y• body also in to small peces. Who herde euer of suche a moder / y• slewe wt her owne handes her owne sone. And lo¯ge tyme after lasted y• reprefe & shame to y• moder / that for bycause   of that one sone / she murdred that other / and so lost them bothe.  How foure kynges curteysly helde all Brytayne / and what be theyr names ye shall here after.   WHan the two brethern were deed they ne had lefte behynde them neyther sone ne doughter ne none other of the kynrede yt might enheryte y• londe And for as moche as the strongest men droue & discomfyted the feblest & toke all theyr londes / so yt in euery coumtree they had grete warre and stryfe vnder them But amo¯ge all other thy¯ges there were foure in the coumtree that ouercame all y• other / & through theyr myght & strength they toke all the londes / & euery of them toke a certayne coumtree / & in his coumtree let call hym kynge / & one of them was called Scater / & he was called kynge of Scotlonde / & that other was called Da walier / & he was kynge of Logres / & of all the londe that was Lotryns yt was Brutes sone. The thyrde was called Ru dac / & he was kynge of Wales. And the fourth was called Cloten / & he was ky¯g of Cornewayle. But this Cloten sholde haue had all the londe by right / bycause there was no man y• wyst none so ryght heyre as he was. But they that were strongest set lytel by them y• were of lesse estate / & therfore this Clote¯ had no more londe amonge them but Cornewayle.  Of kynge Donebant that was Clotens sone / & how he wanne the londe. THis Cloten had a sone that was called Doneba¯t / y• after the deth of his fader became an hardy man and a fayre & a curteys / so y• he passed all the other ky¯ges of fayrnes & of worthynes. And anone as he was knyght he wyst wel that whan his fader lyued he was moost ryghtfull heyre of all y• londe / and sholde haue had it by ryght / but y• other kynges y• were of moche more strength than he toke from hym y• londe. Wherfore this Donebant ordeyned hym a grete power / & conquered fyrst the londe of Logres / and after he went to conquere all the londe of Scotlonde and Wales. And Scater came wt his men & gaue him batayle / & Rudac came also wt his walshe men for to helpe hy¯ / but so it befell y• Rudac was slayne & Scater also in playne batayle. And so Doneba¯t had y• vyctory & conquered all the londe / & well mayntayned it in peas and in quyete / that neuer before it was so well mayntayned.  How Doneba¯t was the fyrst kyng y• euer bare crowne of golde in Brytayne. THis Donebant let make hym a crowne of gold / & ware ye crowne vpon his heed as neuer kyng did before & he ordeyned a statute / yt yfa man had done neuer so moche harme and myght come in to the Temple / there sholde no man hym mysdo / but go there in safete and in peas / & after go in to what londe or countree that hym pleased / without ony harme / and yf ony man had set ony   hande vpon hym / he than  shold  lese his lyfe. And this Donebant made y• towne of Malmesbury / & y• towne also of y• vise And wham he had regned well & worthely .xl. yere he dyed & lyeth at new Troy.  How Brenne & Belyn departed bytwene them the londe after the deth of Donebant theyr fader. And of the warre bytwene them. ANd after y• this Donebant was deed his sones departed y• londe bytwene them as theyr fader had ordeyned / so y• Belyn his eldest sone had all y• londe of Brytayn from Humbar southwarde / & his broder Brenne had all the londe from Humbar to Scotlonde. But for as moche as Belin had y• better part Brenne therfore waxed wroth & wolde haue had more of the londe: & Belyn his broder wolde graumte hy¯ no more / wherfore stryfe & warre arose bytwene them two. But Brenne y• yonger broder had no myght ne strength agaynst Belyn / and therfore Brenne through coumseyll of his folke went fro thens in to Norwey to y• kyng Olsynges / & prayed hym of helpe & so our for to conquere all y• londe vpon Belyn his broder / vpon y• couenaumt yt he wolde haue his doughter to wyfe. And kyng Olsynges hy¯ graumted. And Belin anone as his broder was gone to Norwey he seased in to his ha¯des all y• londe of Northumberlond / & toke all y• castels & let them be arayed / & kept y• coostes of the see y• Brenne sholde not arryue on no syde but y• he were taken. Kyng Olsynges let assemble a grete hoost / & delyuered his doughter to Bre¯ne & all y• people that he had ordeyned. This damoysell Samye had longe tyme loued a kyng y• was called Gutlagh / & to hym she tolde all her coumseyle / & how y• Brenne sholde haue her & lede her with hym for euermore / & so he sholde lese her but that she myght forsake Brenne. And wham Gutlagh had herde these tydynges / he laye for to espye Brenne wt as many shippes as he myght make & haue. So the two fletes mette togyder / & longe tyme they fought / so that Brenne & his men were dyscomfyted. And kynge Gutlagh toke Samye & put her in to his shyppe. And Brenne shamefully fled thens as a man discomfyted. And this kynge Gutlagh wolde haue gone in to his owne toum tre but there came vpon hy¯ so grete a  st that lasted .v. dayes / so y• through y•   pest he was dryuen in to Brytayn with thre shyppes & no moo. And tho y• kepte the coostes of y• see toke Gutlagh & Samye & all his folke / & them presented to Belyn. And Belyn put them in pryson.  How Belyn let departe out of his londe kynge Gutlagh of Denmarke and Samye.  I was not longe after y• Brenne came agayn with a grete nauy & sente to his broder Belyn that he sholde yelde agayn his londe to his wyfe & his folke / & his castles also / or els be worde destroye his londe. Belyn drad noth ge his malyce / & wolde no thynge do   that he had sayd. Wherfore Brenne came with his folke & fought wt B  & Brenne was discomfyted and his folke slayne / & hymselfe fledde with.  . men in to fraumce. And this Belyn that was Brennes broder went than to Yorke / & toke coumseyle what he myght do with kyng Gutlagh / for kyng Gutlagh profered to become his man / & to holde his londe of hym / yeldynge yerely a thousande pounde of syluer for euermore / and for sykernes of this couenaunt to be hol den / Gutlagh sholde brynge hym good hostages / & to hym sholde do homage &   all his folke / & yet he sholde swere vpon a boke y• it sholde neuer be broken ne fayled.  Belyn tho by coumseyle of his folke graumted hym his askyng / & so Gutlagh became his man. And Belyn toke of hy¯ his homage by an othe / & by wrytynge the same couenauntes. And vpon these couenaumtes kynge Guthlagh toke Samie & his folke & went thens & returned agayne to Denmarke. Euermore after were the couenaumtes holden & y• truage payed / tyll the tyme that Hon lus was kyng of Denmarke & also of this londe through his wyfe Gildeburgh y• he had spoused / for she was right heyre of this londe. This Belyn dwelled tho in peas & worshypfully hym helde amonge his barons. And he made foure ryall wayes one from y• eest vnto y• west / & that was called watlyng strete / & an other from y• north vnto the south / & that was called Ikelme strete / and two other wayes he made in bossyng through out y• londe / y• one is called Fosse / and that other Fosse dyke. And he maynteyned well y• good lawes y• Doneba¯t his fader had made & ordeyned in his tyme / as before is sayd.  How accordment was made bytwene Brenne and Belyn through Cornewen that was theyr moder. BRenne that was Belyns broder had longe time dwelled in fraumce & there had conquered a grete lordshyp through maryage. For he was duke of Burgoyne through y• doughter of duke Fewyn y• he had spoused / whiche was right heyre of y• londe. And this Brenne ordeyned a grete power of his folke and also of fraumce / & came in to this londe for to fight wt Belyn his broder. And Belyn came agaynst hym wt a grete power of brytons / & wolde haue gyuen hym batayle. But wham theyr moder Cornewen that than lyued had herde that y• one broder  wold  haue destroyed that other / she went bytwene her sones / & made them accorde wt moche payne. So y• at the last the two bretherne wt moche blysse went togyder in to new Troy / y• now is called London / where they dwelled a yere / & after they toke theyr counseyle for to go & co¯quere all fraumce / & so they dyd / & brent townes & destroyed the londe in lengthe & brede / & the kyng of fraumce gaue them batayle wt his power / but he was ouer comen / & gaue truage to Belyn & to his broder. And after y• they went forth vnto Rome / & conquered it & all Lombardy and Germany / & toke homage of all the chefe lordes & barons. And after they came in to this londe of Brytayn / & dwelled with theyr bryto¯s in ioye & rest. And than made Brenne y• towne of Brystow and after he went ouer to his owne lord ship / & there dwelled he all his lyfe. And Belyn dwelled at newe Troye / & there he made a fayre gate that is called Belynges gate after his owne name. And whan this Belyn had regned nobly. x . yere he dyed / & lyeth at newe Troye.  How kynge Cormbatrus slewe the kyng of Denmarke / for bycause that he wolde not paye to hym his truage.    ANd after this Belyn regned his sone Cormbatrus a good man & a worthy. And the kyng of Denmarke wolde not paye to hym his truage / y• is to say / a. M. pounde as he had sworne by othe for to paye it / & also by wrytyng recorde to Belyn his fader / wherfore he was euylapayed & wroth / & assembled a grete hoost of brytons and went in to Denmarke / & slewe y• kyng Gutlagh / & brought y• londe in subieccyon all newe / & toke of y• folke feaute & homage / & after went agayne in to his owne londe / & as he came forth by Orkeney he foumde. xxx shyppes ful of men & women besyde the coost of y• see / & y• kyng asked what they were. And an erle that was mayster of them all curteysly answered to y• kynge & sayd yt they were exiled out of spayne / & so yt they had trauayled halfe a yere & more in the see / to wyte yf they myght fynde ony kynge in ony londe y• of them wolde haue pite or mercy to gyue them ony londe in ony countree / wherin they myght dwell & haue rest / & become his lyege men / & to hym wold do homage & feaute whyle they lyued & to his heyres after hym / & of hy¯ & of his heyres holde that londe. And whan y• kyng herd this he had pite on them / & gaue them an yle all wyldernes / where no ma¯ was dwellynge / saue onely wylde beestes. And y• erle thanked moche y• kyng & became his man / & dyd hym homage & feaute / & toke all his folke & went in to the same yle And y• erle was called Irlamal / & therfore he let call y• londe Irlonde after his name.

For it is sayd for soth yt it was incredible to be made wt ma¯nes hande / or to be destroyed wt ma¯nes strength / wherof all ye worlde myght take an ensample / and it wolde or myght be enformed.  Tarquinus su{per}bus was the .vij. kyng of Rome & he regned xxxv. yere.

This Tarquinus yt was this seue¯th kynges sone aforesayd came to this ladyes hous (absent her husbo¯de) to sou{per} & to lodgynge. And whan all were a slepe he rose with a swerde in his ha¯de & wt strength &  re he rauisshed ye woman. And wham he was gone she sente vnto her fader & her husbo¯de / for she was of grete kynne / & thus she sayd to them. The kinges sone came hyther as a frende / of whome I had no mistrust / & thus he hath defyled my  hastite / & lost my name for euermore. Wham her frendes sawe her wepe & pyteously complayne / they comforted her as well as they coude / & sayd it was no vylany vnto her / for it was agaynst her wyl. She answered & sayd. Yet shall there neuer   woman excuse herby Lucres: for though she consented not to this dede / yet shal she not dye wtout payn for yt dede. And with that worde she had a knyfe redy vnder her mantell / with whiche she smote her selfe to the hert. And for this cruelnes & this pyteous dethe the people of Rome arose & exiled this kyng & all his {pro}geny for euermore. And thus ceased these kynges of Rome / & neuer was none after.  Of the gouernaumce of Rome tyll the Emperours began. AFter wham this tyraumt was deed the Romayns ordeyned yt there shold neuer be kyng more in Rome. But they wolde be gouerned fro thens forth by consules. So wham those kynges had regned .CC. yere and .xl. they made this statute / that two consules sholde be chosen / & they sholde gouerne the Cite & the people / & for this cause these two were chosen / that yf one of them wolde make ony excesse / yt other sholde gouerne hym For there was no thynge obeyed but yf they consented bothe. Also they  shold  not stande in theyr dignite passyng one yere for this cause. That for dominacyon of longe tyme they sholde not vsurpe more vpon them than was ryghtfull. In all this tyme y• Empyre of Rome was not dilated passyng .xij. myle / ne had no lord ship passing .xij. myle. The fyrst consules that were made y• one was called Lucium & that other Brutum / & these two men did grete thynges in theyr tyme. But yet y• people bare heuy of theyr dominacyon / wherfore they chase an other man / whiche sholde haue more auctorite than they & they called hym Dictator.  In this same tyme there was a grete discencyon bytwene the people & the senate / wherfore they chase Tribunas whiche were Iudges ouer y• people / & defended them from wronge / as sayth ysyder. For the Dictator whan he was chosen he lasted fyue yere / & y• Tribunas were remeued euery yere.  But ye must vnderstande that ye shal not haue here after all y• consules names y• gouerned Rome betwixt the seasyng of y• kynges & y• begynynge of the emperours / for it were to longe to wryte / specyally wham they were euery yere newe / syth that one man myght be chosen so often tymes as we rede. And also for y• enduring of theyr gouernaumce For they were gouernours of Rome .v .C. yere and .lxvij.

This Iulius after he had conquered these coumtrees vnto Rome he rode agayne for to be receyued wt certayne worshyp as co¯querours were before hym / but it was denyed him / & also the entre of ye cite / by instigacyon of a lorde called Pompey. Wherfore this Iult{us} Cesar was anoyed / & wt force of myght entred the cite / & robbed the comyn treasour / & ledde it with hym / & departed it amonge the .v. legyons yt were his seruaumtes. Than went he in to Spayne to fyght agaynst this Pompey / for Pompey had ye gouernaumce of Cartago. But after that iourney in ytalye Pompey & he encoumtred togyder / in which batayle Pompey fledde vnto the kyng of Egipt. And that same kynge for specyall loue yt he had vnto this Iulius Cesar / smo e of Pompeys heed / & sent it to Iulius Cesar. Yet for all ye enemyte yt was betwixt these two / Iulius wepte whan that he same this Pompeys heed. This Iuli{us} was excedyng in wytte afore other men & he fought in batayle .lij. tymes. This man alone exceded Marc{us} Crassus / the whiche is sayd to haue foughten .xxxix. tymes. This man toke fyrst the empyre of Rome vpon hym whan Pompey and other noble men of the Romayns were clayne. And at ye last the fyfth yere of his empyre this Iulius Cesar ye ruler of all the world was slayne in ye coumseyll hous thrugh treason of his lordes.

But for that (after Austyn) he was not excused of synne.  This tyme ye Iury was tributary to the Romayns for parcialite of two bretherne / Aristobolus / & Erranus both of them for enuy of other kest them to ye Romayns that they myght regne.  This tyme thre sonnes appered i heuen towarde the eest parte of ye worlde the whiche by lytel & lytel were brought in to one body. A grete signe it was that Affrica / asia & Europa shold be brought in to one monarchy / & that ye lordshyp of Anthony the senatour & Lucus Anton  sholde turne in to one lordshyp.  Marcus Cicero Tulius ye moost excellent  ethoricien was consul of Rome this tyme.  How that the Britons graumted vnto Cassibalon that was Luddes broder ye londe / in whose tyme Iulius Cesar came twyes for to conquere Brytayne. AFter ye deth of kyng Lud regned his broder Cassibalon & became a good man & moche beloued of his Bry tons / so that for his goodnes & curteysy they graunted hym the realme for euer more to hym and to his heyres. And the kyng of his goodnes let nourysshe worthely bothe the sones yt were Luds his broder / & after made the eldest sone erle of Cornewayle / and the yongest sone he made erle of London. And whyles this Cassibalon regned came Iulius cesar yt was emperour of Rome in to this  o de with a power of romayns / & wold haue bad this londe through strengthe / but   Cassybalon ouercame hym in batayle through helpe of y• bryto¯s / & droue hym out of this londe. And he went agayn to Rome and assembled a grete power an other tyme / and came agayne in to this londe for to gyue batayle to Cassibalon / but he was disco¯fyted through strength of the brytons / & through helpe of y• erle of Cornewayle & the erle of London his broder / and through helpe of Gudyan kynge of scotlonde / and Corbond kynge of north wales / and of Bretayll kyng of south wales. And in this batayle was slayne Nemyon that was Cassybalons broder / wherfore he made moche sorow And so wente Iulius Cesar out of this londe with a fewe of Romayns y• were lefte alyue. And than Cassybalon went agayne to London / & made a feest to all his folke y• had holpen hym. And whan that this feest was all done / than euery man went home to his owne coumtree.  Of the debate that was bytwene Cassybalon & the erle of London / & of the truage that was payde to Rome. ANd after it befell vpon a daye y• the gentylmen of y• ky¯ges housholde / & the gentylmen of y• erles housholde of London after meet went togyder for to playe / & through debate that arose amonge them / Enelin that was y• erles cosyn of London slewe Irenglas that was the kynges cosyn / wherfore y• kynge sware y• Enelyn  shold  be hanged But the erle of London y• was Enelyns lorde wolde not suffre hym / wherfore y• kyng was gretly vexed & worth to war dethe erle / & thought to destroye hym / & pryuely y• erle sent lettres to Iulius Cesar / that he sholde come in to this londe for to helpe hym / & hym auenge vpon y• kyng / & he wold helpe hym with all his myght. And whan the emperour herde these tydynges / he was full glad / & ordeyned a stronge power / & came agayne the thyrde tyme in to this londe / & y• erle of London holpe him with .vij. M. men And at y• thyrde tyme was Cassybalon ouercomen & dyscomfyted / & made peas with the emperour for there thousande pounde of syluer yeldynge by yere for truage for this londe for euermore. And than within halfe a yere after Iulius Cesar the emperour went vnto Rome / and the erle of London with hym. For he durst not abyde in this londe. And after Cassibalon regned .xvij. yere in peas and than he dyed the .xvij. yere of his regne / and lyeth at Yorke.  How the lordes of the londe after the deth of Cassybalon / & for bycause he had none heyre / made Andragen kynge. AFter the deth of Cassybalon for as moche as he had none heyre of his body lefully begoten / the lordes of the londe by the comyns assent crowned Andragen erle of Cornewayle / & made hym kynge. And he regned well & wor  thely / and he was a good man / and well gouerned the londe. And whan he had regned .viij. yere than he dyed / & lyeth at London.  Circa annum mundi .v. M .C .lix.

This Antigonus was sone vnto Aristobolus / and on euery syde he was fals. For he obeyed not to the Romayns and a grete plage he brought vnto the londe for to destroye Hircanus his owne vncle / that he myght regne kynge / and   so Hircan{us} was expulsed / & Falel{us} was slayne / & Herode was exiled. But whan Herode came to Rome & tolde the senatours all these thynges / the emperour created hym kyng / sendyng with hym an hoost / the w the toke Ierusalem / & Antigonum the bysshop was taken & ledde to Anthony y• senatour / the whiche made him syker / & so was Herode co¯fermed in to his kyngdome. And he a straumger regned on the Iewes. And so the kyngdom of the Iewes cessed / as Iacob had sayd.  Titus Liuius historicus / and Ouidius were this tyme.

WHan our lord Iesu Chryst was borne / a well of ayle sprange beyonde Tyber by Rome / & ranne all the daye.  The golden ymage fell the which Romulus had made & put in his palays / sayenge. This ymage shall not fall vntyll a mayde bere a chylde.  Whan Herode dysposed hym to slee y• children of Israel / he was commaumded by the lettre of y• emperour to come to rome to answere to y• accusacyon of his children Alexium & Aristoboli. And there were .iij. Herodes gretly spoken of for theyr yll d  des. The fyrst was called Ascolonita / & vnder this ma¯ was Chryst borne / & the children of Israell were slayne. The second was called Antipas / sone to y• fyrst Herode / vnder whom John baptist was heded / and Chryst suffred deth. And the thyrde was called Agrippa / sone to Aristoboli / sone to y• fyrst Herode / y• whiche slew Iames & prisoned Peter. The first Herode wham he sawe his sones Alexium & Aristoboli through y• prete¯ce of his lettre by the emperour sent / stroue for y• succes syon of his kyngdom / he disposed & made Antipater y• was his first begote¯ sone to be before them / & whan they were tal kyng of y• deth of theyr fader / he kest the¯ away / & they went to y• emperour to co¯playne of y• wronge of theyr fader / & in y• meane tyme y• thre kynges of Coleyn came by Herode to Ierusale¯ / & whan they came not agayn by hy¯ / he thought they were ashamed to come agayn by hy¯ / for bicause they were deceyued / & that they foumde not y• childe as he demed / therfore in y• meane season he cessed to slee y• chyldren of Israell / & than he went to Rome for y• citacyon of the emperour / & he toke his way by y• cite of Tarsum / where he brent y• shyppes in whiche the thre kynges of Coleyne sholde haue sayled in to theyr owne coumtrees. Than after a yere & certayne dayes this Herode came fr    Rome agayn accorded wt his sones / & for the confyrmacyon of his kyngdome he was made moche bolder / & than he slewe all y• children of Bethleem y• were of two yere of age and vnder / that had space of one nyght of age / & amonge these was there one of his owne chyldren. And Ari stobolus & Alexium were had suspected / in so moche as they promysed a barbour a grete rewarde for to cutte theyr faders throte whan he dyd shaue hy¯. And wham this Herode herde this / he was greued and there he slewe bothe his sones. And Herode Agrippa his sone he ordeyned to be kyng. Wherfore Antipater his eldest sone was about to poyson his fader / the whiche Herode Agrippa vnderstode / & prisoned there his broder / the whiche y• emperour herde / & sayd y• he had rather be an hogge of Herodes than to be one of his sones / for his hogges he spareth / & his sones he sleeth. And whan Herode was .lxx. yere of age / he was stryken wt a grete sekenes in his handes & in his feet & in his membres / y• no leche might come to him for stynke / & so dyed. Whan Antipater his sone y• was in prison herd tell of this / he ioyed gretly / & there for y• cause he was slayne. Than Archelaus and Herode stroue for the successyon of y• fyrst Herode afore y• emperour. The emperour there through coumseyle of y• senatours y• halfe of y• Iury & ydumea gaue to Archelaus vnder name of a tetrarche The other parte he deuyded in to two. Galile he gaue to Herode Antipas / and Ituriam & Traconitide¯ he gaue to Philyp Herodes broder.  And y• same yere Chryst came from Egypte. And Archelaus was accused many tymes of the Iewes / & was exiled in to Vienna¯ in to Fraumce. And in y• place were set .iiij. Tetrarches to y• repreuynge of y• vnstablenes of y• Iewes.  And that same yere Octauian the emperour dyed.  Anno Christi .xij. IEsu Chryst our sauyour at .xij. ye re of age herde the doctours in the temple. Our lorde Iesu Chryst at .xxx. yere of age was baptysed. Crux Christi.  Iesu Chryst the lorde of all lordes at. xxxiij yere of age and thre monethes dyed for his seruaumtes.  Innius Rufus was bysshop in the Iury about this tyme. Valerius Gracius was after hym xj. yere. This man openly solde the bysshopryche / & he that gaue moost had it. And so there was many in a lytel whyle  Ponci{us} Pylat{us} was iudge & proctour in the Iury vnder y• emperour. And vnder this man saint Iohn baptyst began to preche. And our lord Iesu Chryst suffred deth / whom Pylate co¯dempned to deth wrongfully for drede of y• emperour.  Tyrus a certayn kyng gate a  hysde on Pyla a poore mannes doughter named Atus / & this chylde of his med rs name & his belsyre put togyder was called Pylatus. This Pylat{us} the .iiij. yere of his age was sent to his fader y• whiche kyng on his wyse lefully had goten a chylde euen of the age of Pylate. And bycause this lefull goten chylde as they proceded in age exceded this bastard Pylatus / he was full of enuye / & slewe his broder the lefull goten childe. Wherfore his fader forth wt sente hym to Rome for pledge for his tribute y• he payd to rome entendyng he wolde neuer redeme hym In the whiche tyme the kynges sone of Fraumce was pledge for his trybute / the   whiche exceded hym in strength & chyualry also he slewe hym. Therfore y• Romayns sent Pylate as a {pro}fytable man for the comyn wele to the yle of Ponto / to tame ye cursed people y• whiche slewe euery Iudge that came to them. And he that cursed man gouerned that vnhappy people / what with thretenynge and with promesse / & with lawe / and with gyftes / that none of them durst do contrary to his pleasure / wherfore he was called Pylate of Ponto.  Herode Antipa yonge in his co¯uersacions / with gyftes and messengers drewe hym to hym and made hym prynce of ye Iury vnder hym. And this tyme Pylate gadred moche money / and Herode not knowynge he went to Rome that he might receyue of the emperour that Herode had gyuen hym. Wherfore Herode & Pylate were enemyes togyder vnto ye passyon of our lorde / whan y• Pylate sent Iesu Chryst vnto Herode clothed in a whyte clothe than they were made frendes.  Ouidius Naso in Ponto aboute this tyme dyed the fourth yere of his exile.  Tiberius this tyme was emperour at Rome / and he regned .xxiij. yere / and he lyued in ye yere that our  lord  Iesu Chryst dyed / & somwhat after. This man was in all his werkes gretly auysed / yt there sholde be nothynge sodeynly done / wyse in warres / studyous in bokes / fayre of speche / fresshe in wytte / saue he wolde oftentymes feyne hy¯selfe to do thynges that he wolde not were done of other. This emperour vnderstode & trusted in Chryst / and worshypped hym for god. Some men saye at ye last he was cruell agaynst the people / but it was a grete reason of pyte yt he was euer gracyous to his subiectes and poore men. And he had peas al his dayes / & all people that sayd agaynst christen folke / without ony mercy he destroyed. And he exiled Pylate for euer. Than he decessed & a worse succeded hym.  After Eusebe it is wryten / that our lord at .xxx. yere of his age chose his .xij. apostles / the whiche made our Crede / that is our byleue / & they made it after the resurreccyon of Chryst and after the holy ghoost was sent vnto them / whan they had chosen Mathia ye apostle / & eche of them made a parte / as it is shewed here after. And this Mathia was chosen bytwene the daye of ye Ascencyon & whytsondaye / in the place of Iudas scaryot ye traytour / of whome in an hystorye is redde thus.  There was a certayn man in Ierusalem that hyght Ruben / & after saynt Ierome he was of the trybe of ysachar / & his wyfe hyght Ciborea / y• whiche on a certayne nyght wham he wolde lustely knowe his wyfe / she dremed that she sholde here a chylde of myschefe / & that chylde sholde be a traytour to his kynge and to all the people of that regyon. And whan that chylde was borne & called Iudas / his fader & his moder abhorred as well to slee theyr chylde / as to nourysshe a traytour to the kynge & all his people / therfore they put hym in to a panyer or leep in to the see. And he flowed to the yle of Scaryoth / where the lady of that place had no chyldren by her husbonde / & she feyned her to be wt chylde / but she fayled And after a lytel season the same lady & quene co¯ceyued a childe of her husbonde And whan he was of age Iudas many tymes angred hym / and caused hym to wepe / the whiche ye quene sawe / & bette Iudas many tymes / & after she knowleged that Iudas was not the kynges sone nor hers / wherfore Iudas slewe y• kynges sone / and he dradde the payne of the lawe / & fledde with certayne exiles to Ierusalem. And whan he came there / he gate hym to Pylates courte that was iudge. And bycause that one   cursed man draweth to another / therfore he drewe to Pylate / & stode gretely in his fauour. And vpon a certayn daye whan Pylate loked out of his palays in to an orcharde of a ma¯nes that was called Ruben the whiche was very fader to Iudas / Pylate desyred to haue apples / and Iudas went to gader apples and Ruben ranne to Iudas for to let hy¯ bycause he toke his apples without ony leue. And after yt they had chydden this Iudas smote his fader on the heed wt a stone & slewe him / & Iudas fledde away secretely after y• dede / but it was sayd y• Ruben died sodeynly. Than Pilate gaue Iudas all Rubens goodes & his wyfe Ciborea yt was his moder. And he delte not curteysly wt her as a man shold do wt his wyfe / wherfore she wepte bycause she had put her sone in y• see / & yt she was maryed agaynst her wyll. It was {per}reyued y• Iudas had slayne his fader & wedded his owne moder. Than Ciborea his moder & wyf styred hy¯ to leue his synne which he dyd & folowed Chryst / & he for gaue hym his synnes / & made hym his proctour & apostle / & how false he was to Chryst it nedeth not to reherse. And ye same yere Mathewe was chosen / & the holy ghoost was sente vnto them as is sayd before. The apostles or they were sparpled in to all ye worlde / they gadered them togyder in Ierusalem / and made the Credo our byleue here folowynge.

Than after he came to Antioch m / & there he abode .vij. yere techynge y• waye of trouth / & Symo¯ Magus he confounded & ouercame. That season he preched to y• people y• were circumcysed whiche were in Ponto of Galati / Capadocia / Asia / Bithinia. Than herd he that Symon Magus deluded y• Romayns through the loue of y• fayth / he came to Rome in y• fourth yere of Claudius the emperour / & there he preched the worde of god / & shewed the falshede of Symon Magus / and turned many a man to y• fayth. Than he sent his prechers by dyuers prouynces / by whome christen religyon was myghtely encreased. He ordeyned the feest of lentyn afore ester / and the aduent / & the  yng dayes to be fasted of all chrysten people / in to the myrrour of y• fyrst & seconde comyng of our lorde. Than whan he had ben pope at Rome .xxv. yere .vij. monethes & .viij. dayes he was slayne of Nero. Ei{us} p a o{per}a vide act.  ap o{rum}.   Gaius this tyme was emperour at Rome / and regned .iij. yere and .x. monethes. This Gaius was full vicyous in lyuyng / for two of his own systers he mysused / & on one of them he gate a doughter / whiche childe he set betwyxt ye knees of Iupiter in the temple / & feyned afterward ye Iupiter had goten her / wherfore he dyd d trye through ye countre ye all men sholde worshyp her as a goddesse. This man also made an ymage lyke hy¯selfe / & sent it to one Patronie president at Ierusalé vnder the Romayns / commaumdyng hym that he shold compell ye iewes to do worshyp therto. And for these enormytees & many other / our lorde suffred hym to be slayne at Rome in his owne palays.  Of kyng Gynder that was Kymbalyns sone / that wolde not paye the truage to Rome for the londe yt Cassibalon had graumted / and how he was slayne of a Romayne. ANd after the deth of this Kymbalyn regned Gynder his sone a good man and a worthy / & was of so hygh herte that he wolde not paye to Rome the trybute that kynge Cassybalon had graunted vnto Iulius Cesar / wherfore the emperour that was than that was Claudius Cesar / was sore anoyed and greued / and ordeyned a grete power of Romayns / and came in to this londe for to conquere y• trybute through myght and strengthe / and for to haue it on the kynge. But this kynge Gynder and Armager his broder assembled and   gadered a grete hoost togyder of Britons and gaue batayle to ye emperour Claudius / & slewe of y• Romayns grete plente. The emperour had afterward one y• was called Hamon y• sawe theyr people were there fast slayne / & pryuely cast awaye his owne armes / & toke y• armes of a deed bryton & armed hym therwith and came in to the batayle to ye kynge / & thus he sayd. Syr be of a good herte for goddes loue / for the Romayns your enemyes anone shall be slayne & disco¯fyted. And the kyng gaue no kepe to his wordes / for bycause of ye armes that he had vpon hym / & wend it had ben a Bryton But the traytour euer helde hym nexte the kynge / & pryuely vnder ye sholder of his arme he smote the kynge / wherfore the kynge dyed & fell downe to the erth. Wham Armager sawe his broder so deed he cast awaye his armes & toke to hym his broders armes / & came in to the batayle amonge ye brytons / & badde them hertely for to fyght & fast lay downe the Romayns. And for ye armes they wende it had ben kyng Gynder that afore was slayne yt they wyst not. Than began the Brytons fyersly to fyght / & slewe the Romayns. So at ye last ye emperour for soke the felde & fledde as fast as he myght wt his folke in to Wynchestre. And the fals traytour Hamon yt had slayne the kyng fast anone began to flee with all ye haste that he might. And Armager ye kynges broder pursued hym full fyersly with a fyers herte / & droue hym vnto a water and there he toke hym / & anone smote of bothe handes & feet & heed / & hewed the body all to peces / & than let cast hym in to the water / wherfore that water was called Hamons hauen. And afterwarde there was made a fayre towne that yet standeth yt is called Southamton. And afterward Armager went to Wynchester to seke Claudius ye Emperour / and there toke hym. And Claudius ye emperour through coumseyle of his Romayns that were lefte alyue made peas wt Armager in this maner folowyng / that is to saye / that Claudius sholde gyue vnto Armager Gennen his doughter to wyfe & that this londe fro that tyme forward shold be in ye emperours power of Rome takyng none other tribute but homage. And they were accorded. And vpon this couenaumt Claudius cesar sente to Rome for his doughter Gennen. And wham she was comen Claudius gaue her to Armager to wyfe. And Armager spoused her at London wt grete solem nite. And than he was crowned kynge of Brytayne.  Of kynge Armager in whose tyme saynt Peter preched in Antioche with other apostles in dyuers coumtrees. THis Armager regned well and worthely & gouerned well ye lo¯de And Claudius cesar in remembraumce of this accorde / & for reuerence & honour of his doughter made in this londe a fa e towne & castell / & let call the towne after his name Claucestren / ye new is called Glocestre. And wham this was all done ye emperour toke his l ue & went to Be . And Armager gate a sone on his wyfe yt was called Westmer. And whyle   Armager regned saint Peter preched in Antioche / & there he made a noble chirche / in ye whiche he sate fyrst in his chayre / & there he dwelled .vij. yere. And after he went to Rome & was made pope tyll yt Nero ye emperour let martyr hym And than preched openly all y• apostles in dyuers londes the true faythe. And whan Armager had regned .xxiiij. yere he dyed / and lyeth at London.  How kyng Westmer gaue to Berynger an ylonde forlet / & there this Berynger made the towne of Berwyk.  ANd after this A ager regned his sone Westmer / that was a good man and a worthy of body / & well gouerned the londe. It befell so that tydynges came to hym on a daye that the kynge Roderyk of Gascoyne was come in to this londe with an huge hoost of people / and was dwellynge in Stanesmore. And whan kyng Westmer herde those tydynges / he let assemble an huge hoost of Brytons / and came to kyng Roderyk & gaue hym batayle. And kynge Westmer slewe Roderik with his owne handes in playne batayle. And whan kynge Roderykes men sawe that theyr lord was slayne / they yelded them all to kynge Westmer / & became his men for euermore. And he gaue them a coumtre yt was forlet wherin they myght dwell / & thyder they went / and dwelled there all theyr lyfe tyme / & .ix .C. men there were of them / & no moo lefte at that batayle. Theyr gouernour & prynce was called Beringer / & anone he began a towne yt they myght therin dwell & haue resorte & let call ye towne Berwyk vpon Twede And there they enhabyted & became ryche. But they had no women amonge them / and the Brytons wolde not gyue theyr doughters to ye straumgers / wherfore they went ouer see in to Irlonde / & brought with them women / and there they them spoused. But the men coude not vnderstande theyr language ne speche of these women / & therfore they spake togyder as scottes. And afterwarde through chaungynge theyr languages in all Fraumce they were than called scottes / and so sholde the folke of that countre be called for euermore.  How kynge Westmer let arere a stone in ye entrynge of Westmerlo¯de there as he slewe Roderyk / & there he began fyrst housynge.   ANd after this batayle that is aboue sayd / whan Roderyk was slayne / kyng Westmer in remembraumce of his vyctory let arere there besydes y• waye a grete stone on hygh / and yet it standeth / and euermore shal stande / and he let graue in the said stone lettres that thus sayd. The kyng Westmer of Brytayne slewe in this place Roderyk his enemy. And this Westmer was ye fyrst that buylded hous and towne in Westmerlonde / and at that stone begynneth Westmerlonde / that Westmer let call after his owne name. And wham Westmer had so done / he dwelled all his lyfe tyme in that countre of Westmerlonde / for he loued that countre aboue all other countrees. And whan he had regned .xxv. yere he dyed / and lyeth at Karleyll.  Of kynge Coyll that was kynge Westmers sone / that helde his londe in peas all his lyfe tyme. COyll Westmers sone was crowned kyng after his fader / and he was a good man & a worthy / & of good co¯dityons / & well gouerned his londe / & of all men he had loue and peas. And in his tyme was neuer contacke / debate / nor warre in Brytayne. And he regned   in peas all his lyfe. And whan he had regned .xi. yere he dyed & lyeth at Yorke. CLaudi{us} was emperour at Rome nexte after Gayus / & he regned xiiij. yere & .viij. dayes. This man came in to grete Britayn now called Englond for to chalenge the trybute whiche they dyd deny to y• Romayns. And after grete batayles there was bytwene the emperour Claudius & Armager kyng of Britayn. And after accordement made that this Armager sholde wedde Claudius doughter / and after they two shold euer lyue in peas / in token wherof this Claudius named ye cite where they were maryed after hym & called it Claudicestre / we call it now Glocestre. This Claudi{us} had .iij. wyues / & on Petiua ye first wyfe he gate a doughter that hyght Antonia The fyrst wyfe decessed and he wedded Messalina¯ & gate a sone y• hyght Britanic{us} / & Octauia a doughter. The thyrde he wedded Agrippina / hauynge a sone that hyght Nero. Claudi{us} wedded his doughter Octauia to Nero his wyues sone. This Claudi{us} for loue yt he had to Agrippina his last wyfe he slewe Messalina his second wyfe / lest she shold haue helpe Britanicus her sone & his to ye empyre. yet Agrippina ye last wyfe of Claudius drad lest her husbonde wolde haue {pro}ferred Britanic{us} & haue deposed Nero her sone / therfore she poysoned her husbonde Claudius / & Nero was {pro}moted to ye empyre. And this same Nero gaue his moder suche a reward agayn / for he poysoned Britanicus & slewe his owne  oder & his wyfe Octauia.  Iames the more y• apostle this tyme was slayne of Herode Agrippa / & Peter was pryso d. vt  p   act .xij. The body of saynt Iames was brought by myr  in to Ga  of Spayne.  Nero after Claudi{us}  s emperour / & he regne  .xiij. yere & vij. monethes. This Nero was a cursed ma¯ / & made grete waste in y• empyre He wolde not fysshe but with nettes of golde & ropes of sylke. A grete parte of ye lordes of Rome he slewe. He was enemy to good men. He slewe his broder & his wyfe / his moder and his mayster. He slewe also Peter & Paule. He wolde neuer were one cloth two tymes. His horses & his mules were shod with syluer. And at the last he dyd set a grete part of Rome on fyre / some saye to se how Troy brent / & some saye the Romayns co¯playned ye stretes were to narowe. And wham he had brent a grete parte of Rome / Nero sayd there was space to buylde y• stretes wyder. Than ye senatours wt the comyn people came vpon hym to  e hym And he fled by nyght in to ye subbarbes of y• cite / & hyd hym amonge ye vynes / & he herde karles & beggers come by hym that sayd / & they wyst where the emperour were / he sholde neuer scape them. Nero thought it sholde be grete derogacion to his name & he were slayne of karles / & on a grete stake he  an hy¯selfe to ye herte & dyed / & there was buryed / & deuyls kepte his body many a day after / & dyd grete hurt to ye people / tyll by a myracle of our lorde ye body was foumde & taken away / & than the deuylles voyded.  Seneca was this tyme maister to Nero.  Iuuenalis poeta.  Lucan{us} poeta.  Iames ye lesse y• apostle bysshop of Ierusalem was slayne of ye Iewes the vj. yere of Nero.  Marcus ye eua¯gelyst was martyred the fyrst yere of hym.  Cir a annum Christi .lxxiiij. Anus ytalicus was pope of Rome .x. yere & .iij. monethes &. xi  dayes. This Lin{us} & his successour Cl tus through theyr holy co¯uersacio¯ were made to mynyster ye treasour of the th  the to the people / Peter beynge alyue            Peter attended to prayer & prechynge. It is redde of this Cletus that he wrote fyrst in his lettres Salute¯ et apostolica¯ vn¯dictione¯. Afore this tyme was many a dyscyple of Peter slayne vnder Nero.  Galba this tyme was emperour / & he regned seuen monethes. This man was made emperour by the power of spayne in the same londe / Nero lyuyng And after the dethe of Nero brought to Rome / & there was slayne of a man that came with whete to Rome. He smote of his heed & bare it to hym that was emperour nexte / seynge all his meu / & none of them helpyng hym.  In this mannes dayes came the grete Rethorycyen to Rome fro Spayne / & was the fyrst ye euer taught ye seyence openly / his name was Quintilian.  Ottho regned after hym / and he regned but thre monethes for one Vitellus that was presydent of Fraumce chalenged the empyre / & in Ytalye bytwene these two were thre grete batayles / & in the fourth batayle Ottha sawe he sholde be ouercomen / & in grete despayre he slewe hymselfe.  Vitellus regned after this Ottho .viij. monethes for he was a folower of Nero / moost specyally in glotony / & in syngynge of foule songes / & at feestes etyng out of mesure that he myght not kepe it.  Vaspasianus regned nexte after hym .ix. yere .x. monethes & .xij. dayes. The well gouerned men of Rome seynge the cursed successyon of Nero / sente after this Vaspasyan vnto Palestyn / for there he was & his sone Titus / whiche had besyeged Ierusalem. And whan he herde yt Nero was deed / by whom he was sent to Ierusalem / and herde of these cursed men regnynge / at the instaumce of these wyse men of Rome / & not wylfully toke vpon hym the empyre. And anone as he was comen to Rome / he ouercame the tyraumt Vitellus / & let hym be drawen through Rome / & after in Tyber tyl he was died and than let hym sayle wtout sepulture for this the people desyred. This man was cured of waspes in his nose anone as he byleued in our lorde Iesu / & that was the cause why he went to Ierusalem to venge Chrystes deth. He fought xxxij. tymes with his enemyes. And he dyed the yere of grace .lxxix.  Anno domini .lxxxiiij. Let{us} a martyr was pope .xi. yere This Cletus was a Romayne / & gretly he loued pilgrimages to sayntes sayenge it was more {pro}fyte to ye helth of mannes soule to visyte the place ye saynt Peter was in / than to fast two yere. He cursed all those men lettynge suche pylgrimages or coumseylers contrary therto. At ye last was martyred by Damacian ye emperour.  Titus soue to Vaspasyan was emperour this tyme / & regned .iij. yere / & he abode styl at Ierusalem after the electyon of his fader / & destroyed the cite / and slewe there (as the story sayth) with batayle & hungre .xi. ho¯dred thousande iewes / and an hondred thousand he toke / & solde .xxx. for a peny / bycause they solde our lord Iesu Chryst for .xxx. pens / & brought theus all thynge that was precyous / & put them in his hous at Rome / whithe was called Te¯plum pa cis. But now is ye place fallen downe for the moost party. And all these precyous iewelles be distrybuted to certayn chirches in Rome. This Citus was so full of vertue that all men loued hym / so fe  forth that they called hym the moost delectable of men. He was full lyberall to all men / in so moche that he sayd often tymes / that there sholde no maner man goo front an Emperoure with an heuy herte / but he sholde no somwhat of his pe icyon. He wolde be sory that day in the whiche he had graunted no man   no benefyte. Whan he was deed / euery man yt was in Rome wepte for hym / as that they had lost theyr fader.  Domician broder to Titus regned after hym xiiij. yere & .v. monethes. Fyrst he was easy / and afterwarde full vnreasonable. For moche of ye senate was destroyed by his malyce / & also moche of his kynrede He began the seconde persecucyon after Nero agaynst chrysten men. In yt whiche persecucyon John ye eua¯gelyst was exiled in to Pathmos after ye emperour had put hy¯ in to a tonne of bre¯nyng oyle & hurte hym not. So this man was not the folower of his fader Vaspasyan / ne his broder Titus / but rather lyke Nero & his kynrede. And for his wycked  o¯dicyons he was slayne in his own palays at Rome in the .xxvij. yere of his age.  Clemens a martyr was pope .ix. yere / and he succeded Cletus. This Clemens fyrst of saynt Peter (as it is sayd) was ordeyned to be successour to him. And for peryll he wolde Linum & Cletum sholde be popes afore hy¯ / lest yt through ye ensample prelates sholde ordeyne vnder them who someuer they wolde. This man made ye lyfe of martyrs to be wryten by regyons / & he made many bokes. He ordeyned yt a chylde sholde be co¯fyrmed as soone as it myght manerly after it was chrystened. And at ye last he was martyred vnder Traian.  Nerua was emperour after Domician one yere & two monethes. And wham he was chosen he meued ye senate to make a lawe / yt all thy¯ge whiche Domician commaumded to be kept shold be broken. By which meane saynt Iohn ye euangelyst was losed out of his exile & suffred to come agayn to Ephese. This man dyd an other thynge ryght commendable / that he assygned so wyse a man as Traian was to gouerne ye people after hym. Nota.  Traian{us} hyspa uicus was Emperour .xix. yere. This Traian{us} many men sayd he was ye best amonge all the Emperours / but in one thynge alone he was vicyous / in so moche as he for ye loue of ye  als goddes was aboute to destroye ye chrysten fayth / iudgynge in hy¯selfe so moost to please god. Some men saye not by hymself / but by other he pursued ye christen fayth / & in ye ende of his lyfe he dyd but fewe to deth. And all his louyng I set at nought. But at saint Gregory meued wt pite wepyng & prayed to our lorde for hym yt he  wold  haue mercy vpon hym / & by his prayer haue hym out of hell / in to whiche place he was dampned. And now yf he be saued or not / a grete alteracyon is amo¯ge doctours. And to vs yt wryte Cron ties it is no parte of our charge to determyn. But all ye eest parte of ye worlde / Babyl  Selencia / the veter partes of the y de. Germayne the seconde after Alexander he helde vnder. In all these thynges so pyteous & so mekely he guyded hym to euery man as a kynge. He was gentyll and to no man vngentyll / the whiche is red of fewe. All the dayes be lyued men sayd he was the moost worthy man in all his empyre. And he thought & sayd euermore yt no man was more vnworthy to be emperour than he.  Anno domini .C .iiij. ANaclet{us} a martyr was pope. i . yere / & he was a Greke. He monysshed all christen men ye preestes sholde be worshipped aboue all other men say enge ye preestes doynge sacrefyce to god sholde be borne out / & not v red but be worshypped. And whan preestes sayd masse they sholde haue wytnes wt them and namely bysshops. Also he decreed ye clerkes sholde were no  erdes nor longe heer. Also yt a bisshop shold be consecrated of thre / & dyuers other thynges. At the   last the .xij. yere of Traian he was mar tyred / & buryed by the body of saynt Peter.  Plinius ye second oratour & philosopher wrote grete thinges. This man meued Traian that he shold withdraw the sentence gyuen agaynst chrysten folke / wrytyng to hym that they dyd none yll / but that they as vertuous folke rose afore day and worshypped Iesu Chryst theyr god secretly in the nyght.  Euaristus a greke and a martyr was .x. yere and .vij. monthes pope after Anaclet{us}. This man ordeyned that man & woman sholde be wedded openly / and that they sholde be blyssed openly of the preest & fader & moder. And he was martyred the  thyrd  yere of Adrian / & buryed by saynt Peter.  Alexander a Romayn was pope .viij. yere & .v. monethes. This man the moost parte of ye senatours he co¯uerted to our lorde. And he ordeyned ye holy water sholde be kest in chrysten mennes houses / & that breed to synge with shold be made of clere breed / and that in lytell quantite. At the last he was martyred vnder Adrian that was emperour / and many he co¯uerted to ye fayth of Chryst.  Sixtus a Romayn was pope .x. yere and .iij. monethes. This man ordeyned Sanctus sanctus sanctus.  &c.  sholde be sayd in ye masse / & that the holy thynges of the chirche sholde not be touched but of mynystres of the chirche. Also that ye corporas  shold  not be made of sylke / but of pure lynnen cloth wouen & not dyed / and that a woman sholde not touche the holy vessell of the awter / ne the pall. Also he ordeyned / that yf ony bysshopryke were vacaumt / that no bysshop sholde be receyued in to his benefyce but with the popes lettres. Also that no masse sholde be sayd but vpon an awter / & at the last he was martyred.  Adrian was emperour .xxi. yere. This Adrian in many thynges is commended / to chrysten men otherwhyle he was gracyous / and certayn of them that wold not do sacrifyce to the fals goddes he slewe. He was an vnyuersall man almoost in all scyences. Peas he had all his dayes but with the Iewes / and many a lawe he made. And than he commaunded that chrysten men sholde not be dampned to deth but with due processe. Ierusalem he subdued agayne / and forbade that no Jewe sholde dwell therin by no wyse. Chrysten men he suffred there to dwell. Agaynst his wyll he came to the empyre / but he gouerned hym very well. Whan the senatours prayed hym to call his sone emperour after hym / he sayd. It is ynough to me yt agaynst my wyl I haue regned whiche I haue not deserued. For ye empyre of Rome sholde not go by succession of blode / but to suche men as deserue it through theyr merytes. Many tymes he regneth vnuertuously that is a kyng borne / and vertue shold come before his kyngdome.  Eustachius otherwyse called Placidus & Therospita his wyfe and two of theyr sones / of whome meruaylous thynges ben redde / were martyred by the commaundement of Adrian. This Placidus was mayster of the emperours knyghtes.  Ierusalem was restored by Adrian and made larger / so that the place where Chryst dyed was within ye walles / yt whiche was without before. And this is the thyrde buyldynge agayne of that cyte. For it was thryes destroyed / that is to saye / of Cal dees in the tyme of zedechie / of Anthiocus in the tyme of Machabeo{rum} / & of Titus in the tyme of Vaspasian.  Anno domini .C .xliiij. Elesphorus a Romayn was pope .xi. yere. This man ordeyned this aumgelles ympne to be songen in the masse Gloria in excelsis deo.  &c.  and the   gospel to be redde afore ye sakeryng / & on Chrystmas day .iij. masses to be songen And he ordeyned there shold no masse be sayd afore .iij. of ye last he was martyred / & buryed at say¯t Peters  Ignius a greke was pope .iiij. yere. This man ordeyned that a childe sholde haue a godfader & a godmoder at baptym & co¯fyrmacyon. Also that no archebysshop (excepted the pope) sholde condempne his suffrygan but yf that the cause were shewed in ye prouyncyall coum seyle of bysshops. Than he was martyred / & buryed at say¯t Peters.  Anthonius Pius was emperour .xxij. yere wt his sones Aurolio & Lucio. This man was myghtely wyse / & naturally fayre of speche / the whiche lyghtly in one ma¯ is not foumde. Nota. Excedynge men in wysdom comynly are not fayre speched nor peasfull namely of nature. Nor contrarywyse. Excedynge men in fayre speche comynly are lesse than wyse. This ma¯ was meued wt bothe these {pro}pertees Therfore many kyngdomes the which receded from other emperours / wylfully to this man returned agayne. And to chrysten men was none so gentyll. He sayd through the ensample of Cipio. I had leuer kepe one heere of a man than slee an hondred of myne enemyes. And some martyrs were made vnder hym / but they were made vnder ye commaunde ment of ye emperours afore. And ye chryste¯ people were so hatefull to ye bysshops & to ye preestes of ye temple of ye fals goddes that they prouoked the princes alwaye agaynst them. For they supposed that ye chryste¯ fayth shold destroye them. Ther fore it was no meruayle (all though the prynce was yll pleased / for they sayd all theyr goddes were deuyls) yf lower iudges pursued christen folke & martired the¯  This tyme .x. M. martyrs were crucifyed in Armenia on an hye hyll called Arath.  Pompeius trogus isto  e¯pore historias to i{us} orbis a Nino vs{que} ad Occauianum deduxit.  Anno domini .C .liiij. PIus ytalicus was pope .xj. yere iiij. monethes & .xij. dayes. This man ordeyned ye feest of eester euermore sholde be halowed on ye sonday. And also an heretyke comynge fro the secte of the Iewes shold be receyued / & be baptysed Than he was martyred & buryed in fast Peters.  Anicet{us} was pope after Pius almoost .x. yere. This man made man  decrees of the Canon & for bysshops. Vt in ca. violatores.  &c.   Galienus a l e goten in pergamo was in grete fame   Rome / yt whiche not all onely expowned the bokes of Ypocras / but he put many of them to his bokes. And of this m  sayd for his discrete abstinence yt   he lyued an .C. and.  l. yere be neuer   ne dranke his fyll. Nota abstinentia¯. He neuer toke rawe fruytes alway he had a swete breth. He dyed all onely through age & no sekenes.  Martus Antonius the true / & Lucius Comodus were emperours .xix. yere. These two toke ye empyre after Anthony the meke. And than began two emperours to regue but Iucius Comodus decesed & Anthony was emperour alone yt whiche was a   ryous man & a noble but that he made the fourth persecucyon to slee chrysten men. This Marcus was of so grete sad nes & stedfastnes / that for no chaumce he neuer laughed / ne chaunged no there / neyther for gladnes ne for sorowe. And whan he was a chylde he was of suche manhode / yt on a certayne tyme wham he loked his tresour / & had not yt whiche he myght gyue his knyghtes & his men / whan he went to fyght agaynst ye Germayns / the Sciauo¯s & Sarmatas / he wolde hurte ne greue no body / but had   leuer to sell his wyues golden vessell / & her arayment / her beddyng & all her ryall stuffe / than take taxe of ye senatours or of his prouynce vnder hym. But he gate ye victory of his enemyes & recouered all agayn / & releaced ye prouynces of theyr tributes. And those y•  wold  sell hy¯ his wyues tresour agayne / he restored them theyr money / & those y• wolde not he neuer greued them. But ye tables of theyr dettes betwixt hy¯ & them he brent openly in ye market place: & thanked them that they helped hym in his necessite.  How kynge Lucie regned after his fader / whiche was a good man / & after he became chrysten. AFter kynge Coyll regned Lucie his sone / that was a good man to god and to all the people. He sente to Rome to Eleuther that than was pope & sayd that he wolde become a chrysten man / & receyue baptym in the name of god / & turne to the right fayth & byleue. Eleuther sente two legates / yt one was called Pagan / and that other Elibayn and came in to this londe & baptised the kynge & all his meyny. And after went from towne to towne and baptysed the people / tyll all the londe was baptysed. And this was in the yere an .C. and. lvj after the incarnacyon of our lorde Iesu Chryst. And than this kyng Lucie made in this londe two archebysshops / one at Caumterbury / & an other at yorke / and many other bysshops that yet be in this londe. And whan these two legates had baptysed all this londe / they ordeyned preestes for to baptyse chyldren / and for to make the sacrament. And after they went agayne to Rome. And the kynge dwelled in this londe and regned with moche honour .xij. yere / and after dyed and lyeth at Glocestre.  How this londe was long without a kynge / & how ye brytons chose a kynge. THis kyng Lucie had none heyre of his body begoten yt was after warde grete harme & sorowe to ye londe. For after this kynge Lucies deth / none of the grete lordes of ye londe wold suffre an other to be kyng / but lyued in warre & debate amonge themselfe .l. yere wtout kyng. But it befell afterwarde y• a grete prynce came fro Rome in to this londe y• was called Seuerye / not for to warre / but for to saue ye ryght of Rome. But neuertheles he had not dwelled halfe a yere in this londe but yt the brytons slewe hym. And whan ye Romayns wyst that Seuerye was so slayne / they sente an other grete lorde in to this londe yt was called Allec that was a stronge man & a myghty of body / & dwelled in this londe longe tyme / & dyd moche sorow to ye brytons / so that after for pure malyce they chose them a kynge amonge them that was called Asclepades / and assembled a grete hoost of Brytons / & went to London to seke Allec / & there they foumde him and slewe hym & all his felawes / & one y• was called walon defended hym fyersly & fought longe with ye Brytons / but at the last he was disco¯fyted / & ye Brytons toke hym & boumde hym handes & feet / & cast hym in to a water / wherfore y• water was called for euermore Walbroke. Than regned Asclepades in peas / tyll one of his erles yt was called Coyl made a fayre towne agaynst ye kynges wyll / & let call y• towne Colchestre after his name / wherfore the kynge was wroth / & thought to destroye hym / and began to warre vpon hy¯ / & brought grete power of men / & gaue ye erle batayle / & the erle defended hym fyersly with his power / & slewe ye kynge hymselfe in that batayle. And than was Coyll crowned and made   kynge of this londe. This Coyll regned nobly / & was well beloued of ye brytons. Whan y• Romayns herde y• Asclepades was slayne / they were wonders glad / & sent an other grete pry¯ce of y• Romayns that was called Constance / & he came to kynge Coyll for to chalenge y• trybute of Rome / which he graumted hym full gladly. So they accorded y• kyng Coyll gaue to hym his doughter Eleyne to wyfe / y• was bothe fayre & wyse & well lettred / & dwelled togyder in loue. And soone after this kyng Coyll dyed in the .xiij. yere of his regne / & lyeth at Colchestre.  How Constance a Romayn that had spoused Eleyne kynge Coyls doughter was chosen kynge after kynge Coyll. AFter this kynge Coyll Constance was made kynge & crowned for as moch as he had spoused kyng Coyls doughter that was heyre of the londe / the whiche Constance regned / & well & worthely gouerned the lo¯de. And he begate on his wyfe Eleyne a sone yt was called Constantyne. And this kyng bare true fayth / & truly dyd to them of Rome all his lyfe. And wham he had regned .xv. yere he dyed / and lyeth at yorke.  How Constantyne that was kynge Constances sone & sone to saynt Eleyne gouerned and ruled the londe / and after was emperour of Rome. AFter kynge Constance deth regned Constantyne his sone & sone to saynt Eleyne that foumde y• holy crosse in the holy londe / & how Constantyne became emperour of Rome. It befell that in that tyme there was an emperour at Rome yt was a sarasyn & a tyraumt yt was called Maxence / whiche put to deth al y• byleued in god / & destroyed holy chirche by all his power / & slewe all chryste¯ men that he myght fynde / & amo¯ge all other he let martyr saynt Katheryne / & many other christen people yt had drede of deth fled & came in to this londe to kyng Constantyne / & tolde hym of y• sorowe that Maxence dyd to chryste¯ folke / wherfore Constantyn had pite / & made grete sorow & assembled a grete host & a grete power and went ouer vnto Rome / & there toke the cyte / & slewe all y• was therin of mys byleue. And than was he made emperour / & was a good man / and gouerned hym so well / y• all londes were to hy¯ attendaumt for to be vnder his gouernaumce.  And this deuyll & tyraumt Ma  y• tyme was in the londe of Grece & herde these tydy¯ges / & sodeynly became wood & dyed sodeynly.  Whan Constantyne went from this londe to Rome he toke with hy¯ his moder Eleyne for her grete prudence / & thre other grete lordes y•   moost loued / the one was called Howell & y• other Taberne / & ye thyrde Mo . And toke all his londe to kepe to ye erle of Cornewayle that was called Octauian And anone as this Octauian wyst that his lorde dwelled at Rome incontynent he cesed all the londe into his handes & therwith dyd all his wyll amo¯ge   & lowe / & they helde hym for kyng. Whan these tydynges came to Constantyne the emperour / he was wonders wroth towarde the erle Octauyan and sent Taberne with .xij. M. men agaynst hym & they arryued at Portesmouth. Whan Octauian wyst that he let assembled a grete power of Brytons & dyscomfyted hym. And Taberne fledde in to Scotlonde / & ordeyned there a grete power / & came agayne in to this londe another tyme for to gyue batayle to Octauyan. And whan Octauyan vnderstode that / he assembled a grete power / and came towarde Taberne as fast as he myght /    so that those two hoostes mette togyder on Stanesmore / & strongly smote togyder. And than was Octauyan dysco¯fyted / & fledde thens vnto Norway. And Taberne seased all ye londe in to his handes bothe townes & castelles. But Octauyan came agayne fro Norway with a grete power / & droue out al ye Romayns & than he was made kyng of this lond.  How Maximian that was the emperours cosyn of Rome spoused Octauyans doughter / and after was made kynge of this londe.   THis Octauian gouerned ye londe well and nobly / but he had none heyre / saue a doughter that was a yonge chylde / that he loued as moche as his lyf. And for as moche as he waxed seke and was in poynt of deth and might no longer regne / he wolde haue made one of his neuewes to be kyng / which was a noble knyght & a stronge man yt was called Conan Meriedok: & he shold haue kepte the kynges doughter / & haue maryed her whan tyme had ben. But the lordes of ye londe wolde not suffre it / but gaue her coumseyle to be maryed to some hygh man of grete honour / & than might she haue al her lust / & the coumseyle of her lord Consta¯tyne ye emperour. And at this coumseyle they accorded / & chose Cador of Cornewayle for to go to ye emperour on this message / & he toke ye waye & went to Rome / & tolde the emperour these tydynges well & wysely. And ye emperour sent in to this londe with hym his owne cosyn that was his vncles sone a noble knyght & a stronge yt was called Maximyan / & he spoused Octauyans doughter / & was crowned kyng of this londe.  How Maximian that was the emperours cosyn conquered ye londe of Amorican / & gaue it to Conan Meriedok. THis kyng Maximian became so ryall yt he thought to conquere ye londe of Amorican for ye grete rychesse yt he herde tell that was in y• londe / so yt he ne left no man of worthynes / knyght ne squyer / ne none other ma¯ yt he ne toke wt him / to ye grete domage of all ye lo¯de. For he lefte at home no man to kepe ye londe / for he had wt hym .xxx. M. knyghtes of good mennes bodyes / & went ouer in to the londe of Amorican / & there slewe the kyng that was called Imball / and conquered all the londe. And whan he had so done / he called Conan & sayd. For as moche as kyng Octauyan wolde haue made you kyng of Brytayn / & through me ye were let & dystroubled y• ye were not kyng / I gyue you this lo¯de of Amorican / & make you kyng therof. And for as moche as ye be a bryton / I wyl that this lo¯de haue the same name / and that it be no more called Amorican / but shall be called lytell Brytayne / and the londe fro whens we be comen / shall be called fro hens forth grete Brytayne. And so shall men knowe that one Brytayne fro that other. Than this Conan Meriedok   thanked hy¯ curteysly / & so was he made kynge of lytell Brytayn. And whan all this was done Maximyan went from thens vnto Rome / and was than made emperour after Constantyne. And Conan Meriedok dwelled in lytell Britayn with moche honour / & there let ordeyne two. M. plowmen of the londe for to ere the londe / to harowe & sowe it / & feffed them rychely after yt they were. And for as moche as kynge Conan & none of his knyghtes / ne none of his other people wolde not take wyues of the nacyon of fraumce / he sent in to grete Brytayne to ye erle of Cornewayle that men called Dio nothe / that he sholde chose through out all this lo¯de .xj. M. maydens / that is to saye .viij. M. for the meane people / & .iij. M. for ye gretest lordes that sholde them spouse. And wham Dionothe vnderstode this / he made a commaumdement through out all the londe of Brytayn / & as many as the nombre came to he assembled togyder of mayde¯s / for there was no man that durst withstande his commaumdement bycause he was protectour. And whan these maydens were assembled / he let them come before hym at London / & let ordeyne shyppes for them hastely / wt all that therto belonged. And toke his own doughter that was called Vrsula / that was ye fayrest creature y• ony man wyst And he wolde haue sent her to kyng Conan yt shold haue spoused her & made her quene of ye londe. But she had made pryuely to god a vowe of chastite yt her fader wyst not / ne none other man lyuynge.  How Vrsula and .xj. M. maydens that were in her company wente towarde lytell Brytayne / and all they were martyred at Coleyne. THis Vrsula those vnto her company .xj. M. maydens that of all other she was lady & maystresse / and all they toke shyppynge at one tyme in the water that is called Tamyse / & commaumded her kyn & frendes to almyghty god and sayled toward lytell Brytayn. But whan they were comen in to ye hygh see a stronge tempest arose as it was goddes wyll / & Vrsula with her shyppes & her company were dryue¯ to Hunlo¯de through tempest / & arryued in y• hauen of the cite of Coleyne. And the kynge of the londe that was called Gowan was than in y• cite / & whan he wyst the tydynges that so many fayre maydens were there arryued / he toke Elga his broder & other of his housholde with hym and went to the shyppes to se that fayre company. And whan he sawe them so fayre / he & his company  wold  haue ouer ayen them and haue taken fro them theyr virgy te. But Vrsula that good virgyn counseyled / prayed / warned / & taught then: that were her felawes / that they shol  defend them with all theyr myght / and rather suffre deth than suffre theyr bodyes to be defouled. So that all the virgyns became so stedfast in god that they defended them through his grace that none of them had power to do them shame. Wherfore kynge Gowan was sort anoyed / that he for wrathe slewe them euerychone anone ryght. And so were all those virgyns martyred for the  our of god / and they lye at Coleyn.  How kynge Gowan came for to destroye this londe / and how a man of grete power that was called Gracian defended the londe. WHan all this was done / kynge Gowan whiche was a sarasyn called to hym his broder Elga and sayd to hym that he sholde go and conquere the londe that all those fayre   maydens were borne in. And than he ordeyned a grete power of Pehites of denmarke / of Orkeney / & of Norway. And they came in to this londe & brent townes / & slewe folke / & cast down chirches & houses of religyon / & robbed the londe in length & brede / & put to deth all those that wolde not forsake ye ryght byleue & chryste¯dom. For as moche as there was no souerayne yt myght helpe them. For the kyng Maximian had taken wt hym all ye worthy men whan he went to conquere lytell Brytayn. And in ye same tyme was saynt Albon martyred through the wode tyraumt Dioclesyan / in ye same place where is now an abbey made of saynt Albons / whyles yt he was a paynym. But he was conuerted vnto god through the predycacyon of a clerke & a wyse man that was called Ancibel that was herborowed a nyght in his hous. And this was after ye incarnacion of Iesu Chryst .CC .xxvj. yere. And it is to be vndersta¯de that saint Albon suffred his martyrdom before saynt Edmond. And therfore is say¯t Albon called ye fyrst martyr of Englonde.  This Gowans broder & his folke that were sarasyns went through out the londe and destroyed all thynge yt they founde & no thynge they spared. Whan these tydynges came to Rome how ye kynge Gowan had begon for to destroye this londe / the emperour & the Romayns sent a stronge man & of grete power yt was called Gracien with xxiiij. M. fyghtynge men / for to cast out of this londe all those sarasyns. And all they arryued at Portesmouth. Maximian myght not come himselfe bycause he was chosen emperour after the deth of Constantyne yt was saynt Eleyns sone Whan this Gracian was arriued with his hoost / he let espye pryuely where ye kynge Gowan myght be foumde / & he set vpom them sodeynly as they lay in theyr beddes / & disco¯fyted them & slewe them in theyr beddes euerichone / that none of them escaped: saue Gowan yt fledde in to his owne coumtre wt grete sorowe. Soone after it befell ye Maximyan was slayne at Rome through treason. And whan Gracian wyst of those tydynges / he let crowne hymselfe kynge of this londe.  How Gracian made him kyng whan Maximyan was slayne / & afterward ye Britons slewe hym for his wyckednes. THis Gracian whan he began to regne / he became so wycked and so sterne / and so moche sorow dyd to the Brytons that they slewe hym amonge them. Whan kyng Gowan vnderstode that Gracian was slayne / he assembled a grete power & came agayne in to this londe / and yf he had fyrst done harme than dyd he moche more. For he than destroyed all this londe and the chrysten people that were therin / so that no man was so hardy to name god / and yf they dyd they were put to straumge deth. But the bysshop of London yt was tho whiche was called Gosselyn scaped & went thens to them of Rome to seke socour to helpe to destroye the sarasyns that had destroyed this londe. And the Romayns sayd yt they had ben so often anoyed for theyr sendyng of folke in to Britayne all for to helpe the Britons / & they wold no more so do. And so the bysshop Gosselyn went thens without ony socour or helpe. And than went he to ye kyng of lytell Brytayne yt was called Aldroie / & this was ye thyrde kyng after Gowan Meriedok / as before is sayd. The bysshop prayed this kynge Aldroie of helpe & socour. And ye kynge had pite in his herte whan he herde how ye bysshop fledde / & how the chrysten men were so slayne in grete Brytayne through ye paynyms &   sarasyns / he graumted hym Constantyne his bro er for to helpe hym with power of folke. And cha  dyd araye hors / harneys & shyppes & all thynge yt neded to that vyage. And whan all thynge was redy / he called ye bysshop & sayd to hym. I take you here Constantyne my broder vpon this couenaumt / yt yf god gyue hym grace to disco¯fyte ye infydele¯s / that than ye shall make hym kyng. And ye bisshop graumted it wt a good wyll. Constantyne & the bysshop toke leue of ye kyng Aldroie / & betoke hym to god / & toke .xij. M inen & went to theyr shippes / & sayled towarde grete Britayn / & arryued at Totnes. Whan ye Britons herdethese tydynges that socour came / they were glad / & ordeyned them an huge non re of people / & went & receyued them wt moche honour  Gowan anone as he wyst of these ty dynges / he assembled all his farasyns & came agaynst them & gaue the¯ batayle. And Constantyn slewe hym wt his owne handes / & all the other sarasyns were dyscomfyted & slayne yt none escaped / excepte those that were couerted to god.  How Constantyne that was the kynges broder of lytel Britayn was crowned kynge of grete Brytayne for his worthynes. ANone after ye batayle they went to London & crowned there Constantyne kyng of this londe / & ye bysshop Gosselin set the crowne on his heed / and a oynted hy¯ as it belongeth for a kyng. And than began christendom in this londe agayn. And anone after wham this kyng Constantyn was crowned he spoused a wyfe through roumseyle of ye Brytons / & begate on herthre sones. The fyrst was called Constance / ye seconde Aurilambros & the thyrde Vter. This Constance yt elder broder wham he came to o  he   hym a monke at Wynchestre. And Consta¯tyne theyr fader was slayne through treason. For it befell vpon a tyme that a Pehyte came to hym vpon a daye as it were on a message / & sayd that he wolde speke with the kynge pryuely in coumseyle. The kyng let  oyde his chambre of the men that were there within / and there abode no moo but the kynge and the Pehite / and he made a countenaumce as though he wolde haue spoken with the kyng in his eere. And there he shewe hym with a longe knyfe. And after that he went meruaylously out of that chambre in to an other chambre / so that at the last no man wyst where he was b romen. Whan the kynges men wyst that theyr lord was so deed / they made than so moche sorowe / yt they wyst not what for to do. For as moche as his two sones Aurilambros and Vter were so yonge / that none of them myght be kynge and the thyrde broder was a monke at   chestre as is sayd before. But  o nger that was erle of Westler thought pryuely in his herte through some subry e for to be kynge hymselfe. And wente to Wynchestre where as Constance was monke / & sayd to hym. Constance qued be your fader is deed / & your two brethern that ben wt Gosselyn the bysshop of London to nourysshe / be so yonge that neue of them may be kyng wherfore I coumseyle you that ye forsake your habyte & come with me / and I shall make suche a meane vnto the Brytons that ye shall be made kynge of this londe.  Of Constance that was kynge Constantynes sone / whiche was a monke at Wynchestre / and how he was made kynge after his faders dethe / through counseyle of  o ger that was  e of Westser for as moche as Aurilambros and   his two bretherne were but   yonge of age. And Vortiger let shee  ya  for to be kynge hymselfe. THis Vortiger coumseyled this Cons a¯ce so moche tyll he forsoke his ab ot and went with hym. And anone after he was crowned kyng by ye assent of the Brytons. This kynge Constance whan he was crowned & made kynge he wyll ne knewe but lytell of ye worlde nor coude no thynge what knyghthode axed. And he made Vortyger his chefe mayster & coumseyler / & gaue hym all his power for to ordeyn & to do as moche as to ye realme aperteyned. So yt hymselfe no thynge entermedled / but onely bare the name of kyng. Wham Vortiger sawe that he had all ye lo¯de in his warde & gouernaumce at his owne wyll / he thought by preuy treason to slee Constance ye kyng that he myght hy¯selfe be crowned & made kyng & regne / & let sende after an hondred knyghtes of Pehytes / ye worthyest of all ye londe / & them helde wt hym for to dwell / as to be kepers of his body / as he wolde go through the londe to ordeyne thynges yt appertayned to a kyng. And this Vortiger honoured so moche ye hondred knyghtes & so moche gaue them of golde & syluer & of ryche iewelles / robes horses & other thy¯ges plente / wherfore they helde hym more lord than they dyd the kyng. And Vortiger told them: yf he myght be kyng / ye as it were through treason / he wold make them rychest of ye londe. So at ye last through grete gyftes that he had gyuen largely / they cryed through ye court yt Vortiger were better worthy to be kyng than Constance. Wherfore Vortiger made semblaumt as he had ben wroth / & he departed thens from ye courte / and sayd he must go elles where for thinges that he had to do. And so the traytour sayd bycause yt they sholde slee kynge Constance. Whan this Vortiger was gone / it befel soon easter   those hondred knyghtes of Pe ites wiche the dores of ye kynges chambre / & there they slewe hy¯ / & smote of his heed & ba e it to Vortiger there as he dwelled. And wham Vortiger sawe ye heed / he wepte full tenderly wt his eyen / & neuertheles he was somdele gladde in his herte of his deth. And anone Vortiger let take those hondred knyghtes of Pehites / & hadde his seruaumtes bynde theyr haudes behynde them & lede them to London / and there they were dampned to deth as fals traytours. And anone after all ye Brytons of the londe by the comyn assent crowned Vortiger & made hym kyng of ye londe.  Auno domini .C .lxxiiij.

The fyrst thynge that Dioclesian dyd / he brent all the chrysten mennes bokes that myght be foumde. These two tyraumtes dyd more harme to christen men than euer dyd ony other. For .x. yere lasted theyr {per}secucyon And as we rede / wtin .xxx. dayes .xx. M. men were slayne for chrystes cause. And in Englonde all the fayth was almoost destroyed in the tyme of Maximyan.  Gaius was pope after Euticianus. This man ordeyned that no man sholde accuse a bisshop or an other clerke to ony seculer iudge. And yt a pagan or an heretyke shold not accuse a christen man. Also he ordeyned that he that was worthy shold ascende gree by gree to his ordres / fyrst benet / than  ollet / subdeken / deken & than preest. And at ye last he was martyred vnder Dioclesian.  Marcell {us} a martyr was pope after Gaius .xi. yere & .iiij. monethes. This ma¯ was sore {per}secuted / & for drede of deth he offred.  .  nes of encense to ye sacrifyce of ye ydolles. And afterward he openly repented and suffred deth for the fayth of Chryst. His body laye vnburyed thre days for drede of the curse of god. And after through a visyon of saynt Peter & Marcell he was buryed at saynt Peters fo e.  Marcellus was pope after Marcell {us} .v. yere. This man ordeyned that a generall coumseyle myght not be ordeyned without ye auctorite of ye pope. vt  p   .xvij. d .  . sinodum. Also he chose .xv. cardynalles in the cyte to bury men & chrysten. At the last whan he had kepte beestes longe tyme in a hous closed in with them by ye commaundement of Maximian he dyed for faute.  Eusebius a martyr was after this man two monethes and certayne days. This man of a lay man was made pope / & he ordeyned that no laye man shold accuse his bisshop / but yf he went from his fayth. V   p   .ij .ix. vij .x. lai s.  Nota. This tyme saynt Albon was   martyred in brytayn. This Albon wham he was a pagan he lodged a certayn ma¯ the which co¯uerted hym to the fayth / & after was iudged vnto deth / and moche people he turned vnto our lorde yt were nygh ye water / the which he made drye through his prayer. And he suffred deth nygh the cite of Ve elom. Vide plura in vita sctin Albani.  Melchiades a martyr succeded Eusebius foure yere. This ma¯ forbode ye men  shold  fast on sondays & on thursdays / in so moche as pagans fast on those dayes. At the last he was martyred as al his predecessours were.  And knowe ye that there were. xxxiij popes of Rome martyred eche one after other. Peter was the fyrst / & this Melchiades was the last. And than it was laudable (after Gregory) a ma¯ to desyre a bysshopryche.  Galerius was emperour after Dioclesian two yere / and an other with hym called Constancius / so was ye empyre in those dayes deuyded. This Constancius after he had conquered all Spayne / he came in to grete Britayn / & there he wedded a ky¯ges doughter / on whom he gate grete Constantyne And this same Constancius dyed in Brytayn / & lyeth at Yorke / as Martin sayth in his cronycles / & lefte on lyue Constantyne that was goten on Eleyne / & was kynge of Brytayne & of Fraunce.  Anno Christi .CCC .viij. SIluester was pope after Melchiades. This was a gloryous confessour / & many wayes he worshypped ye chirche of god / what in wrytynge and what in myracles. He receyued the patrimony of saynt Peter / that is for to saye / the kyngdome of Ytalye with the cite of Rome of Constantyne the emperour / & to the worshyp of the chirche of god he turned it. He baptysed Eleyne & the Iewes / and than he decessed a confessour.  Constantyne ye myghty was emperour this tyme. This Constantyne was a gloryous man and a victoryous in batayle. In gouernyng of the comyn people he was very wyse. And in ye necessite of ye byleue he was without comparison deuoute. His pite & his holynes be so wryten in ye bokes of holy doctours that without doubte he is to be nonbred amonge sayntes. And the Grekes saye that in the ende of his lyf he was made a monke. And more ye may here of hym in the cronycles of englonde / for he was kyng of Englonde.  Helena the quent moder to Constantyne repayred agayn the holy crosse this tyme / and she made lxx. colleges / and she gloryfyed the state of all holy chirche.  Nycholas the bysshop of Myrre cite an holy ma¯ was this tyme.  Athanasi{us} was this tyme bysshop in Alexandria a gloryous doctour / and made the cymbalum Q uicum{que} vult saluus esse.  &c.   Marcus was pope after Siluester two yere and .viij. monethes. This man ordeyned that ye Crede sholde be openly songen in the chirche / and that the bysshop of Hostiense sholde consecrate the pope / and that he sholde were a pall.  Iulius was pope after Marcus .xj. yere. This man was exiled x. yere / & after suffred deth vnder Constantyne the seconde.  Constantinus wt his two bretherne regned .xxiiij. yere / & in his last ende he was peruerted by the heresy of ye arryens / by a bysshop called Eusebi / & he pursued the chirche of god strongly. The ende of this ma¯ was this As he sholde go to Constantynople to a grete coumseyle / in the whiche counseyle he thought to haue co¯dempned the bysshop and the clerkes of true byleue / he wente before vnto a chambre to auoyde suche thinges as nature requyreth / & anone sodeynly his bowelles fell from hym   and so dyed.  Libersus was pope after Iulius .xix. yere and .vij. monethes. Than was ye seconde dyscorde of ye chirche bytwene Liberi{us} & Felix for ye heresy of the arryens the whiche fauoured Liberius. Than Constancius ye emperour called agayne Liberius from his exyle bycause he fauoured this heresy. And ye chirche deiected Liberius / & toke Felix for pope / and the other was expulsed as an heretyke of the chirche. But Felix obteyned not / for ye emperour put in Liberius & expulsed Felix.  Felix was pope after the deth of this Liberius / & he declared Constancius ye emperour an heretyke / and anone after he was martyred.  And here was the fyrst that euer the chirche of Rome had an infamed pope. For all ye predecessours of this Liberius were sayntes / & gaue holy ensamples.  Iulianus apostata was after Constancius emperour .ij. yere and .viij. monethes. He was called apostata bycause he fledde this Constantius whiche slewe his broder / & for fere of deth was made a chrysten man and a monke. But afterwarde by ye counseyle of a nygromancer he asked the deuyll wheder he sholde be emperour or not. The deuyll sayd that he sholde be emperour vpon a co¯dycyon that he sholde forsake his chryste¯ fayth / and be vtter enemy to chryste¯ men. And so he dyd / for he gaue leue to the Iewes that they sholde buylde agayn ye temple in spyte of ye christen men. And toke all ye goodes ye chrysten men had / & destroyed many of them.  Iouinianus was emperoure after hym .viij. monethes. For whan Iulian was deed the hoost chose hym emperour / & he was a christen man And he sayd it was not lefull to a christen man to be lord ouer so many hethen people. They answered & said. Rather than he sholde forsake the empyre they  wold  be thrystened. And thus toke he ye dignite. But soone he was deed / and in meruaylous maner. For he was layde in a close hous (after his iourney) made all of stone / newly whyted with lyme / in ye whiche they made to his comfort as they thought a fyre of charcole / & of ye ayre of these two on the morowe he was foumde deed.  Valentinian wt his broder Valent was emperour after Iouinian{us}. x . yere / for he departed the empyre / & gaue his broder the eest / & kepte hymselfe the west part. This Vale¯tinian was a lord with Iulian apostata / & it happed him on a tyme for to go in to a temple of false goddes for to do sacryfyce / & mynystres stode there with water halowed after theyr guyse / with ye whiche they spryncled the lordes. This Vale¯tinian smote the mynystre that kest the water vpon hym / and sayd he was rather defouled therby than clensed. Bycause of this Iulian dyd exile hym. But our lord god for his open confessyon of his name rewarded hym with ye empyre. His broder Valent fell in to the opinyon of the a yans and dyed in that heresy. This same Valent lyued foure yere after Valentinian with Gracian the emperour.  This tyme lyued saynt Ambrose.  Anno domini .CCC .lxiiij. DAmasus was pope after Felix xviij. yere & .ij. monethes. This was an eloquent man in metre / and he wrote many storyes of popes and martyrs. He ordeyned that   patri  shold  be sayd in the ende of the psalmes / and that was at the prayer of saynt Ierom. And through ye mocyon of this pope Ierom translated the byble from hebrewe in to latyn / & than he decessed a co¯fessour  Valent with Gracian & Valentinian were emperours foure yere. In this tyme were chirches opened agayne / and   chrysten men had leue to renewe the seruyce of god y• was defended afore wt emperours infected wt heresy / as was Valens & other / wherfore y• chirche had no liberte whan Valens was on lyue.  A synodus of an .C. and .l. bysshops were gadred vnder Damase pope at Constantinople agaynst Macedonium an heretike the whiche denyed y• holy ghost to be very god. And than was the Credo made that is songe on holy dayes in y• chirche  Augustinus a Cartaginen¯ of Affrica was this tyme / he was as noble a retho ricyen as myght be / & in all philosophy & poetry incomparable / & all thynge that ony philosopher foumde in his youth / he vnderstode wt lytell labour. And aboute this tyme he was sent to Milan where he was turned anone of saynt Ambrose and baptysed. This man grewe vnto a noble doctour of y• chirche. And not longe after that he was bysshop of Yponen¯. & there he lyued .liij. yere / & moche diuinite he wrote. vt  p   in libris suis.  Siritius was pope after Damasus .xv. yere He dampned heretykes / & lytell elles is wryten of hym.  Theodosius sone to Gracian with Vale¯tyne his vncle was emperour .xxvij. yere. This man was a chrysten man & a gracyous / & in gouernaumce lyke to Traian / soone wroth / and anone reconsyled. This man on a daye whan he  wold  haue gone to here masse saynt Ambrose forbade hym the entre of the chirche tyll he had done penaunce / & made satisfaccyon for y• sleynge of y•. xxx knyghtes / whiche he slewe in angre at Constantinople. Wherfore they made a lawe that y• sentence of a prynce shold be deferred .xxx. days of those that shold do execucyon yf they myght fall in y• grace of y• prynce wt in the .xxx. days.  About this tyme was a childe borne in y• castell of Emons from y• nauyll & aboue deuyded in to two bodyes / hauyng .ij. hedes and two wyttes / so that the one  epyng or erynge / that other slepte nor ete not / & wham they were two yere of age / the one decessed / & that other lyued thre days after.  Claudius poeta was this tyme.  Arcadius & Honori{us} regned .xxx. yere And in theyr tyme Rome was almoost destroyed by a kynge called Alaticus / of the whiche destruccyon rose a grete blas phemy of the Romayns. For they sayd they fared neuer well sythen Chryst came to Rome / & bereued the¯ theyr goddes by the prechynge of Peter & Paule. And yet this Archadius subdued all his enemyes by y• power of god / & shed no blode Agaynst this blasphemy saynt Austyn made y• solempne werke y• whiche they call. de ciuitate dei.  Honori{us} was emperour wt Theodosius his broders sone xv. yere / & he was a man of holy lyf / for two wyues he had / and with bothe yet he dyed mayden. He loued specyally the chirche / and hated heretykes.  Ierom dyed this tyme at Bethleem the yere of his age .lxxxxj.  Sanct{us} Herachydes that wrote Vitas patrum to Lansum epmm was this tyme.  Ioh¯es Crisostomus was exiled of Eudochia ye wyfe of Arcadij / & through hete of the sonne he dyed.  Anastasius was pope after Siritius thre yere. This ma¯ ordeyned that euery man sholde stande at ye redyng of ye holy gospell / & that he that was a maymed man sholde not be preest.  Innocentius was pope after Anastasius. This man ordeyned that seke men sholde be enoynted with holy oyle. And at masse ye kysse of peas to be gyuen. He dampned Pelagien an heretyke. And many other thynges he dyd. vt patet .xxvj. q .j.  Anno Christi .CCCC .xiiij. AFter Innocentius zozimus was pope two yere & .viij. monethes. This man ordeyned that clerkes sholde   be no tauerners / ne sell no wyne / & that a bonde man sholde not be made preest without y• lycence of his lord.  Bonifa cius a Romayn was pope after zozim{us} foure yere. This man ordeyned y• a woman sholde not touche y• pall of y• awter ne sholde not wasshe y• awter.  Celestinus a Romayn was pope after Bonifacius .viij. yere & .ix. dayes / y• whiche ordeyned the psalme afore masse Iudica me deus.  &c.  And at the begy¯nynge of y• masse sholde be sayd a verse of a psalme and that y• Grayle & the offertory sholde be sayd afore the sakerynge. This man sent saynt Patryk in to Irlonde to conuerte that lond. And Palladius a deken of Rome to the Scottes to be conuerted. And in the fourth yere of this ma¯ there was a generall Synody at Ephisina of CCC. bysshops agaynst Nestorium an heretyke.  Theodosius y• yonger with Valentinian his neuewe regned .xxvij. yere. In his tyme was y• leest ordeyned whiche is called Aduincula sancti Petri. And in his tyme dyed saint Austyn / in y• yere of his age .lxxvj.  And this tyme were the .vij. slepers reysed / the whiche slepte .CC. yere. This man dyed at Constantynople / & there was buryed. This tyme the saxons entred in to Englonde / and anone by lytell & lytell they grewe vp mightely / & at the last they obteyned all the londe.  Sixtus a Romain was pope after Celestinus .viij. yere. This was a holy man & a meke. And lytell of hym is wryten / but y• he buylded sancta Maria maior.  Leo Tuscus a confessour was pope after Sixtus. This ma¯ was as holy as ony ma¯. Fyue tymes on a day or more he wolde saye masse. And on a tyme after it befell whan a certayn woman kyssed his hande he was tempted with her / & for the trespace that he had done / to his penaumce he made his hande to be stryken of. And whan y• noyse  ose vpon hym that he myght not say masse as he was wont to do / he was ryght sory / and all onely betoke hym in prayer to our lady to helpe hym. And our lady restored hym his hande agayne / & than he sayd masse as he was wont to do / & so that myracle was openly shewed to all people.  And in y• tyme of this pope Marcyan the Emperour beynge there was congregate at Calcedony y• fourth vniuersall synody of. vj .C. and .xxx. bysshops agaynst Eusticem y• abbot of Constantinople. et Alexandrinum epmm: qui negauerunt in Christo vera¯ carne¯ fuisse et etia¯ negabant carnis nr¯e resurrectione¯. And after he had made many notable sermons & epystles he decessed.  Marcianus & Vale¯tinian{us} were emperours this tyme .vij. yere / in whose tyme was the grete Synody afore rehersed whan Eustice¯ & Dioscorus were co¯demp rd. IN the tyme that Marcian{us} was emperour of Rome Vortiger was kynge of Britayn now called Englonde in whose tyme y• saxons came in to Bry tayn & made many kynges / y• is to saye as is playne by the Cronycles .vij. And bycause it is tedyous to mannes reason to reherse many diuers names togyder as .vij. kynges of Englonde / and in one tyme / the emperours and popes. Therfore the cronycles of Englo¯de shall be set togyder / tyll it be comen vnto Alured / in whose tyme the Danes came in to Englonde. And the popes and y• emperours & other thinges in the same tyme shall be set togyder.  Circa annum d  .CCCC .xlix.  How the wardeyns that had y• chysdren to kepe y• were kyng Constantynes sones ladde them to lytell Brytayne / for the treason and fals es of Vortiger.  Here begynneth the fyfth parte durynge to the comynge of the Danes.  Engist. THis tyme came the saxons that were pagans fyrst in to Britayn now called Englonde / vnder Vortiger y• whiche was crowned kyng of this londe. This tyme those that had these two chyldren in kepyng the which were Constantynes sones / that is to saye / Aurilambros and Vter through ordynaunce of Gosselyn that was bysshop of London / after theyr faders dethe / that is to saye Constantyne / durst not dwell in this londe with those children / but conuayed them vnto the kynge of lytell Brytayn / for as moche as he knewe the treason of Vortiger that than was made kynge / through whome Constance theyr elder broder was slayne / wherfore y• hondred knyghtes of Pehytes were put to deth and bare al the blame / as that Vortiger had not wyst therof / ne therto consented. And so the kepers of those two chyldren dred lest Vortiger wolde put the¯ to deth through his treason & falsnes as he had done theyr broder before / & therfore they were ladde ouer in to lytell Brytayne / & the kynge them receyued wt moche honour / & put them to nourysshe / & there they dwelled tyll they became fayre and stronge knyghtes / & thought to be auenged of the deth of Constance theyr broder whan they sawe theyr tyme / & so they dyd as ye shal here tell afterward.  It was not longe after that the tydynges came ouer see to the kynrede of the hondred knyghtes of Pehytes y• they were dampned & put to deth through Vortiger in this londe / wherfore they were wondersly wroth / and swore that they wolde be auenged of the dethe of theyr kynnesmen / & came in to this lond with a grete power / & robbed & slewe in many places / & dyd all the sorowe that they myght. Whan Vortiger it wyst / he ma de moche sorowe / and was sore anoyed. And in another place also tydnges came to hym that Aurilambros and Vter his broder ordeyned and assembled a grete hoost for to come in to grete Britayn / for to be auenged vpon Vortiger for y• deth of theyr broder Constance. So that on y• one syde & on the other he was brought in to so moche sorowe that he ne wyst wheder to go.  How Engyst and .xj. thousande men came in to this lo¯de / to whom Vortiger gaue a place y• is called Thonge castell. ANd soone after this sorowe tydynges came to Vortiger that a grete nauye of straumgers were arryued in y• coumtree of Kent / & wyst not whens they were / ne wherfore they were comen in to this londe. The kynge sent anone a messenger thyder / that some of them sholde come & speke wt hym for to knowe what folke they were / & what they asked / & in to what coumtre they wolde go. There were two bretherne maysters & prynces of that stronge company / y• one was called Engist / & that other Horne. Engist went to the kyng and tolde hym the cause wherfore they were comen in to this londe / & sayd. Syr we be of a coum tree y• is called Saxonie / that is y• londe of Germayne / wherin is so moche sorowe that of the people be so many that   the londe may not them susteyne. And y• prynces & maisters of the londe make to come before them men & women of y• bold st y• may best trauayle in to diuers lon des / & gyue them hors & harneys / & al y• them nedeth / & than they byd them go in to an other to  e where they may lyue as theyr aumceters dyd before them. And therfore syr kynge / yf ye wyll haue our seruice we wyll helpe you against your enemyes. Whan Vortiger herd this / he sayd gladly he wold wtholde them vpon suche couenaumt y• yf they might delyuer his londe of his enemyes / he wold gyue them reasonable lo¯des for to dwell in for euer. Engist thanked hym goodly / & in this maner he & his company .xj. M. were reteyned wt kyng Vortiger / & at the last delyuered clene y• londe of his enemyes. Than prayed Engist the kyng of so moche lo¯de y• he myght make for hym & his folke a cite. The kyng answered / it was not to do wtout coumseyle of his brytons. Engist prayed hym agayn of as moche place as he might compasse wt a thonge of a skyn / wheron he might make a maner for hy¯ to dwell in. And y• kyng graumted him frely. Than Engist cut a bulles skyn as small as he myght in to a tho¯ge & therwt compassed as moche lond as he myght buylde on a fayre castell / & was called Thong castell.  How Vortiger loued Ronewen Engistes doughter / & how he spoused her.   WHan this castell was made and well arayd / Engist pryuely sent by lettre in to the coumtree where he came fro for an hondred shyppes fylled with men that were stronge & bolde and also well fyghtyng in all batayles / and that they sholde also brynge with them Ronewen his doughter / whiche was the fayrest creature that ony man myght se. And whan those people were comen that he had sente for / he toke and ladde them in to the castell with moche Ioye. And hymselfe vpon a daye went vnto the kynge / and prayed hym there full worthely that he wolde come and se his newe manoyr that he had made in the place that he had compassed with the thonge of the skynne. The kynge anone frely graunted hym / & went with hym thyder / and was full well pleased with the castell & with the fayre weeke And togyder there they ete and dranke with moche ioye. And whan nyght came that kynge Vortiger sholde go in to his chambre to take there his nyghtes rest / Ronewen y• was Engistes doughter came with a cup of golde in her ha¯de and kneled before the kynge and sayd to hym wassayll. And the kynge wyst no  what it was to mene  e what he shold answere therto / for as moche as hym selfe nor none of his brytons coude speke none Englysshe nor vnderstande it / but spake in y• same language that Britons do yet. Neuerthelesse a latiner tolde the kynge the full vnderstandynge of wa sayll / & that other shold answere drynke hayll. And that was the fyrst tyme that wassayll and drynke hayll came vp in this londe / and from that tyme vnto this tyme it is well vsed in all this realme of Englonde. And whan kynge Vortiger behelde y• grete beaute of this fayre lady Ronewen that kneled before hym / he toke her vp & layde bothe his armes   aboute her necke / & thryes swetely kyssed her / & anone ryght he was enamoured vpon her / so that he desyred to haue her to wyfe / and asked her of Engist her fader. And Engist graunted hym vpon this couenaumt / that the kyng shold gyue hym all ye coumtree of Kent / that he & his people myght dwell therin. The kynge graumted hym pryuely with a good wyll And anone after he spoused ye damoysell and that was moche confusyon to hym selfe. And therfore all ye brytons became wrothe bycause he spoused a woman of mysbyleue / wherfore they went all from hy¯ / & wold do no thynge yt he had to do.  How Vortimer that was Vortigers sone was made kyng / & Engyst dryuen out / & how Vortimer was poysoned. THis Engist went in to Kent and seased all ye londe in to his ha¯des for hym & for his men / & became within a lytel whyle of so grete power / & had so moche people / that men wyst not in litel tyme whiche were ye ky¯ges men & whiche were Engystes / wherfore the Brytons had of hym drede / & sayd amonge them / but yf they ne toke other coumseyle bytwene them / all the londe  shold  be destroyed through Engist and his people. Vortiger ye kyng had begote¯ on his fyrst wyfe thre sones / ye fyrst was called Vortimer / the seconde Catagren / & ye thyrde Passent. The bryto¯s by one assent chose Vortimer to be theyr lorde & souerayne / & crowned hym kyng / & wold not suffre Vortiger no longer to regne / bycause of the alyaumce bytwene Engist and hym. The brytons ordeyned a grete hoost for to dryue out Engist & his company of ye londe / and gaue hym thre batayles / the fyrst was in Kent where he was lorde / the seconde was at  Tetford  / & ye thyrde was in a shyre on this side Colchestre in a moor. And in this batayle mette them Catagren & Horne Engystes broder / so that eche of them slewe other. But for as moche as ye coumtre was gyuen longe before to Horne through Vortiger wham he spoused his cosyn / there he made a fayre castell that is called Horne castell after his owne name. Vortimer was so sore anoyed for his broders deth / that anone he let cast downe ye castell to ye erth. And after he stynted not nyght nor daye tyll he had dryuen out Engyst & all his people of the londe. And than Ronewen his doughter made grete sorowe / and craftely spake to them that were nexte to the kyng Vortimer / & pryuely entreated them / and so many gyftes she gaue them / that the kynge was empoysoned and dyed at London the fourth yere of his regne / and there he lyeth.  How the britons chose an other tyme Vortiger to be theyr kynge / and Engist came in to this londe agayne / and how they fought togyder. AFter Vortimers dethe the Brytons by theyr comyn assent made Vortiger agayne theyr kynge vpon this couenaunt / that he sholde neuer after suffre Engist nor none of his to come agayne in to this londe. And whan all this was done / Ronewen the quene pryuely sent by lettre to Engist that she had empoysoned Vortimer / and that Vortiger her lorde bare agayne the crowne & regned / and that he sholde come agayne in to this londe wel arayed with moche people for to auenge hym vpon the brytons / and to wynne this londe agayne by myght and strength. And whan Engist herde these tydynges / he made grete ioye / & apparayled hym hastely with xv. thousande men that were boughty in euery batayle / & came in to this londe.   And whan Vortiger herde tell that Engist was comen agayn with a grete power in to this londe / he assembled his brytons & went to mete Engist for to gyue hym batayle. But Engist dredyng ye brytons sore / for they had dysco¯fyted hy¯ before / prayed Vortiger of a loue day / & sayd he was not comen in to this londe for to fyght / but for to haue his londe agayn / yf he myght accord wt the bryto¯s. Kyng Vortiger through coumseyle of his brytons graumted hym a loue day. And it was ordeyned by the brytons yt the loue daye shold be holden besyde Salysbury on an hyll / & Engyst sholde come thyder with. iiij .C. knyghtes & no moo. And ye kyng wt as many of ye wysest men of his londe. And at yt daye ye kyng came wt his coumseyle as it was ordeined. But Engist had warned his knightes pryuely that eche of them sholde put a longe knyfe in his hose / & whan he sayd fayre syrs it is tyme to speke of loue & peas / euery man anone shold drawe out his knyfe & slee a bryton. And so they slewe a. M. and .lxj. knyghtes / & with moche sorowe many o  them escaped. And ye kynge Vortiger there was taken & ledde to Thongcastel and put in prison. And some of Engistes men wolde that the kyng had ben brent all quycke. And Vortiger than for to haue his lyfe graunted them as moche as they wolde aske / & gaue vp all the londe townes / castelles / cytees & bourghes to Engyst & his folke. And all the brytons fledde thens in to Wales / & there helde them styll. And Engist went through ye londe & seased all the londe wt fraumchises & in euery place let cast down chirches & houses of religyon / & destroyed ye chryste¯ fayth through out all this londe / and let chaumge the name of ye londe / yt no man of his were so hardy after that tyme to cal this lo¯de Britayn / but call it Engist lo¯de And than he departed ye londe to his men and made .vij. kynges for to strengthe ye londe / that ye brytons sholde neuer after come therin. The fyrst kyngdome was Kent / where Engist hymselfe regned / & was lorde & mayster ouer all the other. The .ij. was Southsex / yt now is called Chichestre. The .iij. Westsex. The .iiij. Eestsex. The .v. Estangyl / yt now is called Norfolk / Suffolk / Mercheme k / yt is to saye ye erledom of Nicholl. The. v . had Leycestre shyre / Northamton shyre Herforde / & Huntyngdon. The .vij. had Oxforde / Glocestre / Wynchestre / Warwyk / and Derby shyre.  How Vortiger wente in to Wales / & began there a castell yt wolde not stande without morter tempred with blode. WHan Engist had departed all the londe in this maner to his men / & delyuered Vortiger out of pryson to go where he wold / & he toke his way in to wales where his brytons dwelled / for yt londe was stronge & yll to wynne / & Engist neuer came there  e neuer knewe  . Vortiger helde hym there wt his bryto¯s & asked coumseyle what was best to do  & they gaue hy¯ coumseyle to make a strong castell / yt he might kepe & defende hy¯self therin yf nede were.  Masons in haste were fette / & began ye werke vpon ye hyll of Breigh. But certes thus it befel  all ye werke yt the masons made a daye  t fe l downe ye night / & they wyst not what it myght be / & therof ye kynge was sore anoyed of yt chaumce / & wyst not what to do Wherfore he let send after ye wysest clerkes & lerned men that were through out wales yt myght be foumde / for they  shold  hym tell wherfore ye foumdament so fayled vnder the werke / & that they shold hym tell what was best to do. And wham these wyse men longe tyme had studyed / they sayd to ye kyng yt he sholde do seke a childe borne of a woman yt neuer had to do   with man / and that chylde he sholde do slee / & tempre with his blode the morter of the werke / and so sholde the werke euer endure without ende.  How ye kyng let seke Merlin through out all Wales for to speke with hym.   WHan the kyng herde this / he commaumded his messengers anone to go through out all Wales to seke that chylde / yf they myght fynde hym / and that they sholde brynge hym forth with them vnto hym. And in recorde and in wytnes of this thynge he had taken them his lettres / that they ne were destroubled of no man ne lette. And than ye messengers went thens & spedde so fast / that they came in to a town that was called Karmardyne / and as they passed forth theyr waye / they foumde two chyldren of .xxiiij. yere of age chydynge togyder with hasty wordes / and one of them sayd to that other. Donebat quod he / ye do all wronge to stryue with me / for ye haue no wytte ne no reason as I haue. Certes Merlyn quod he / of your wytte ne your reason I make no forte / for men tell comynly yt ye haue no thy¯ge of god almyghty / syth ye had neuer fader / but euery man knoweth well who was your moder.  The messengers of kynge Vortiger whan they herde this stryfe bytwene ye two gromes / they asked of them yt stode besyde them whens that Merlyn was borne / and also who nourysshed hym. And they tolde them yt a grete gentylwoman of Karmardyne called Adhan was his moder / but none knewe who was his fader. Whan the kynges messengers herd these tydy¯ges they went anone to hym that was wardeyne of ye towne & tolde hym ye kynges wyll / & shewed hym his lettre / & wherfore they were comen thyder. Merlyn & his moder anone were fetched before the wardeyn of ye towne / & he commaumded the¯ that they sholde go to ye kynge with his messengers. Merlyn & his moder went thens & came vnto ye kyng / & there they were receyued wt moche honour. And ye kyng asked of the lady yf yt chylde were her sone / & who hym begate. The lady answered full tenderly wepynge & sayd she neuer had company of man worldly But syr sayd she / whan I was a yonge mayden in my faders chambre / wt other of grete lignage in my company / that often tymes went to sporte them / I left alone in my chambre & wolde not go forth for bre¯nynge of ye sonne / there came on a tyme a fayre bacheler & entred in my chambre where I was alone / but how he came in / & where / I wyst it neuer / ne yet knowe I not / for ye dores were fast barred / & wt me he dyd game of loue. For I had no myght nor power to defende me from hy¯. And often he came to me in ye fore sayd maner / so yt he begate this chylde / but neuer myght I wyte what he was.  Of the answere of Merlyn vpon the kynges castell that wolde not stande. WHan Merlyn had herde all that his moder had sayd / he spake to the kynge in this maner.  Syr   how I was begoten aske ye no more / for it falleth not to you nor to none other to knowe / but tell me ye cause wherfore I am brought to you / & wherfore ye haue sent for me. Certes quod the kynge / my wyse coumseylers haue done me to vnderstande / that ye morter of a werke that I haue begon behoueth to be te¯pred with your blode / or the foumdament shall fayle for euermore. Syr said Merlin / wyll ye slee me for my blode to tempre with your morter. Ye quod the kynge / or elles shall neuer my castell sta¯de / as my coumseylers tell me. Than answered Merlyn to the kyng. Syr said he / let them come before me those wyse coumseylers / & I wyll preue that they saye not well ne truly. And whan the wyse men were comen / Merlyn asked yf his blode were the cause to make ye werke stande & endure. All those wyse men were abasshed and coude not answere. Than sayd Merlyn to ye kyng Syr I shall tell you the cause wherfore your werke thus falleth & may not stande. There is vnder the mountayn where ye buylde your toure a grete pond of water / & in the bottom of ye ponde vnder the water there is two dragons / that one is whyte & that other reed / that fyght togyder agaynst your werke. Do ye depe myne tyll your men come to the pond / & do your men take away ye water all out & than ye shal se the dragons as I haue tolde you / yt fight togyder agaynst your werke. And this is the cause wherfore the foumdament falleth. The kyng anone let dygge vnder tyll ye men came to that ponde / & let do away all ye water / & there they foumde two dragons as Merlin had tolde them that egerly f ught togyder. The whyte dragon egerly assayled the reed / & layde on hym so strongly that he myght not endure / but withdrewe him   rested in the same caue. And whan he had a whyle rested hym / he went before the reed dragon & assayled hym angerly & helde hym so sore / that he myght not endure agaynst hym / but wt drewe hym & rested. And after came agayn ye whyte dragon & strongly fought wt the reed dragon / & bote hym euyl & ouercame hym ye he fled from thens & no more came agayn.  Of the significacyon of these two dragons that were in the bottom of the ponde that fought togyder. His kyng Vortiger & his men ye sawe this bataile had grete meruayle / & prayed Merlyn to tell hy¯ what it myght betoken. Syr sayd Merlyn / I shall tell you. The reed dragon betokeneth your selfe / & the whyte betokeneth the folke of Saxonie that fyrst ye toke & helde in your lond / that fought agaynst you / & haue dryuen & chaced you awaye But Britons of your lignage ouercame them & droue them awaye. And sythen at the comynge agayne of the Sarons they recouered this londe / & helde it for euermore / & droue out the bryto¯s / & dyd with this lo¯de al theyr wyll & destroyed chrystendom through out this londe. Ye had fyrst ioye wt theyr comyng / but now it is turned to your grete domage & sorowe. For the two bretherne of Constance that was kyng / whiche ye let see shall come before a quinzeme passed wt a grete power from lytel Brytayn / & shall auenge the deth of theyr broder / and they shall brenne you fyrst with sorowe / and afterwarde they shall slee a grete parte of saxons / & shall dryue out all ye  emenaumt of the londe / & therfore abyde ye here no lenger to make castel ne none other w rke / but anone go els where to saue your lyfe. To god I you betake / trouth I haue sayd to you of thynges yt shall be fall. And vnderstande ye well that Aurilam bros shall be kynge / but he shall be poysoned / & lytell tyme shall he regne.  Of kynge Aurilambros / and how he pursued Vortiger and Eugist / and how they dyed. MErlyn & his moder departed from the kynge / and returned agayne to Karmardyne. And soone after tydynges came to the Brytons that Aurilam bros and Vter his broder were arryued at Totnes with a grete host. And anone the Brytons assembled them and went to receyue Aurilambros and Vter with grete noblenes / & brought them to London / and crowned Aurilambros & made hym kyng / and dyd vnto hym homage. And anone he asked where as Vortiger myght be foumde that was kynge / for he wolde be auenged of his broders deth / and after he wolde warre vpon ye paynyms. And they tolde hym that Vortiger was in wales / & so they ladde hym thyder warde. Vortiger wyst well that those bretherne came to conquere hym / and fledde thens into a castell that was called Gerneth / that stode vpon an hye mountayne / and there helde hym. Aurilambros and Vter his broder and theyr folke had besyeged the castell full longe tyme / for the castell was stronge & well arayed. So at the last they kest wylde fyre and brente houses and men and all theyr araye & as moche as was within the castell. So that Vortiger was brent amonge all other / and so he dyed with moche sorowe.  Than was Engist in Kent and regned there / and herde these tydynges / anone he fledde & wolde haue gone in to Scotlonde for to haue had socoure. But Aurilambros and his folke mette with hym in the north countree / and gaue hym batayle. And Engist and his men defended them whyles yt they myght / but he and his folke were dyscomfited and slayne. And Otta his sone fledde vnto yorke. And Aurilambros folowed hym egerly. And Otta with stode hym a lytell whyle / but afterwarde he put hym to his mercy. And Aurilabros receyued hym / and to hym & to his men gaue the countree of Galeway in Scotlonde / & there they dwelled. After that the kynge Aurilambros went through out the londe / and put awaye the name of Engyst londe / that Engyst after his name had called it before. Than he let call it agayne grete Brytayne / and let make agayn chirches and houses of relygyon / castelles / cytees / and borowes and townes that the Saxous had destroyed / and came to London / and dyd do make the walles of the cyte / whiche Engist & his folke had cast downe. The Brytons ladde hym to the mount of Ambrian where somtyme was an hous of relygyon whiche than was destroyed through ye paynyms / wherof a knyght that was called Ambry that somtyme was founder of that hous / and therfore the hyll was called the mount of Ambryan. And after it was called Ambesbury / and shall be so for euermore.  How Aurilambros dyd redresse the londe of grete Brytayne / whiche was destroyed through the Saxons. HOw the kynge Aurilambros let amende and redresse the hous of Ambesbury / and put there in monkes / but now there be Nonnes / alytell from the place that was called Salysbury / or where as the Saxons slewe the Britons / where as Engist and the Britons sholde haue made a loue daye / in yt whiche tyme there were slayne a thousande & .lxj. knyghtes through treason of Engist. The kynge therof had grete pyte / & thought to make in mynde of them a monument of stone that myght endure to the worldes ende. And of this thynge   they toke theyr counseyle what therof was best to do. Than spake to ye kynge the bysshop of London that was called Ternekyn yt he shold enquyre after Mer lyn / for he coude best tell how this thy¯ge myght best be made. And Merlyn after was sought & foumde / & came to ye kynge. And the kyng tolde hym his wyll of the monument yt he wold haue made. Merlyn answered to ye kynge & sayd. There ben grete stones in Irlond & longe vpon the hyll of Kian yt ben called gyaumtes ka roll / & yf they were in this place as they be there / they wold endure for euermore in remembraumce of those knyghtes that here be buryed. Perma foy sayd ye kyng as harde stones ben in my lo¯de as in Ir lo¯de. Soth sayd Merlyn / but in all your londe there be none suche. For gyauntes set them for grete good of themselfe. For at euery tyme yt they were wounded or in ony maner hurt / they wasshed ye stones with hote water / and than they wasshed them therwith / & anone they were hole.  How the Brytons went for to seke the grete stones in Irlonde. ANd wham these Britons had herd of this thy¯ge they went & swore amonge them that they wolde goo seke those stones / & toke with them Vter the ky¯ges broder to be theyr chefe capitayn and .v. M. men / & Merlin coumseyled them for to go vnto Irlonde / and so they dyd. And whan the kynge of Irlonde yt was called Guillomer herde tell ye straumgers were arriued in his londe / he assembled a grete power / & fought agaynst them / but he & his folke were disco¯fyted. The Brytons wente before tyll they came to the mount of Kylian / & clymmed vp vnto the mount. But whan they sawe the stones / & the maner how they stode / they had grete meruayle / and sayd bytwene themselfe that no man sholde them remeue for no strength ne engyne so grete they were & so lo¯ge. But Merlin thrugh his crafte he remeued them / & brought them in to theyr shyppes & came agayn in to this londe. And Merlin set ye stones where the kyng wolde haue them / & set them in the same maner that they stode in Irlonde. And whan ye kynge sawe yt it was made / he thanked Merlin & ryche ly hym rewarded at his own wyll / & let call ye place Stonehenge for euermore.  How Passent yt was Vortigers sone & kyng Guillomer came in to this londe & how a traytour that was called Cappa empoysoned ye kyng Aurilambros. ANd men shall vndersta¯de ye Passent yt was Vortigers sone liued the same tyme / & came in to this lond wt a grete power / & arryued in ye north coumtre / & wold be aue¯ged of his faders deth Vortiger / & strongly trusted vpon ye com pany that he had brought wt hym out of the londe of Germany / & had conquered all ye North coumtre vnto Yorke. And wham kyng Aurilambros herde this he assem bled a grete power of britons & went for to fyght with Passent / & he discomfyted Passent and al his people. But Passent escaped thens with some of his men & fledde thens in to Irlo¯de & came to kyng Guillomer / & prayed hym of helpe & socour. The kynge graumted hym wt good wyll / & sayd yt he wold helpe hym vpon that couenaunt that I my selfe must go with you with all my power in to Brytayne / and I wold me auenge vpon the Brytons the rather / for they came in to my londe / & toke ye stones with strength that is called gyaumtes karoll. The kyng Guillomer let ordeyne his shyppes and went to the see with .xv.  . men / & arryued in wales / & began to robbe & dyd   moche sorowe.  It befell so that kyng Aurilambros lay feke at Wynchestre / & myght not helpe hymselfe. So that he sent in his name Vter his broder with a power to helpe wales / & thyderwarde he went as moche as he myght. The kyng of Irlonde and Passent had herde tell that Aurilambros was seke / and to them there came a sarasyn yt was called Coppa / and sayd. Syr dwell ye here all in peas wt your hoost / & I behyght you through my queyntyse yt I shall slee the kynge Aurilambros that is seke. Than sayd Passent / yf ye do so I shall rychely aua i e you. This traytour Coppa put vpon hym an habyte of relygyon / & let shaue hym a brode crowne / & came vnto the kynges courte / & sayd that he wolde helpe ye kyng of his malady. Than sayd the traytour Coppa vnto ye kynge. Syr be of good conforte / for I shall gyue you suche a medycyne yt ye shall swete anone ryght and lyst to slepe & haue good rest. And ye traytour gaue hym suche poyson to slepe / that anone ryght in his slepyng he dyed / & the traytour sayd yt he wolde go out in to ye felde tyll he were awaked And so escaped he away / for no man had to hym suspeccyon for bycause of his ha byte that he was clothed in / and also for his brode shauen crowne. But whan the kynges men wyst yt he was deed / they became wonders sory / & fast sought the traytour / but they myght not fynde hy¯. For that traytour returned agayne vnto the hoost fro whens he came.  Whan Aurilambros was deed / a sterre on ye morow was seen wt a clere lyght / & at yt bought of the beme was seen the heed of an horryble dragon. WHan the kyng Aurila¯bros was thus deed & empoisoned at wyn chestre / on ye morowe after that he was deed aboute the tyme of pryme there was seen a sterre grete & clere / & ye beme of ye sterre was bryghter than the soune / & at the bought of the beme appe red a dragons heed / & out of his mouth came two huge lyghtes that were as bryght as ony fyre brennynge / & the one beme toward fraumce & streyght ouer the see thyderwarde / & out of ye beme came vij. bemes full clere & longe as it were ye lyght fyre. This sterre was seen of many a man / but none of them wyst what it betokened. Vter that was kyng Auri lambros broder yt was in Wales with his hoost of Brytons sawe that sterre / & the grete light that it gaue / he wondred therof gretly what it myght betoken / & let call Merlyn / & prayed hym for to tell what it myght betoken.  Of the betokenynge of the sterre. MErlyn sawe that sterre & behelde it longe tyme / & sythen he quoke and wept tenderly / and sayd. Alas alas that so noble a kynge and so worthy is deed. And I do you to vnderstande that Aurila¯bros your broder is empoysoned and that I se well in this sterre / & your selfe is betokened by the heed of the dragon that is seen at the bought of ye beme that is your selfe that shall be kyng and regne. And by ye beme yt sta¯deth toward the eest is vnderstande that ye shall gete a sone that shall conquere all Fraunce / & all the londes yt belongeth to the crowne of fraumce / that shall be a worthyer kyng and of more honour than euer was ony of his aunceters. And by the beme that stretcheth toward Irlonde is betokened that ye shall haue a doughter that shall be quene of Irlonde. And the .vij. bemes betoken that ye shall haue .vij. sones / & euery one of them shall be kynge / & shall regne with moch honour. And abyde ye   no longer here / but go & gyue batayle to your enemyes / & fyght wt them boldly / for ye shal ouercome them & haue ye victo ry. Vter thanked Merlyn hertely / & toke his men & went towarde his enemyes / & they fought togyder mortally / & so he discomfyted his enemyes and destroyed them / & hymselfe slewe Passent yt was Vortigers sone. And his Britons slewe Guillomer that was kynge of Irlonde and all his men. And Vter anone after ye batayle toke his waye towarde Wynthestre for to do bury kynge Aurila¯bros that was his broder. But than was the body borne to Stonehenge with moche honour / that he had do make in remem braumce of the Brytons that there were slayne through treason of Engyst / that same daye that they sholde haue ben accorded / and in ye same place they buryed Aurylambros / the seconde yere of his regne with all the worship that myght belonge vnto suche a kynge. On Whose soule god haue mercy. Amen.  Of Vter pendragon / & wherfore he was called so ye shall here. And how he was ouertaken wt the loue of Igreyne yt was the erles wyfe of Cornewayle. AFter the dethe of Aurilambros Vter his broder was crowned & regned worthely. And i remembraumce of the dragon that he was likened to / he let make two dragons through coumseyle of his Britons / & made that one for to be borne before hym wham he went in to ba tayle / & that other for to abyde at Wynchestre in the bysshops chirche. And for that cause he was called euer after Vter pendragon. And Otta yt was Engistes sone commended Vter but lytell that was made newe king / & agaynst hym began to moue warre / & ordeyned a grete company of his frendes / & of his kynne / & of Ossa his broder / & had taken all ye londe from Humber vnto Yorke. But those of Yorke helde strongly agaynst them / and wold not suffre them to come in to ye cite neyther to yelde ye cite to them / & he besyeged the towne anone ryght / & gaue therto a stronge assaute / but they of yt cite kepte them well & strongly. And whan Vter herde therof / he came thyder wt a grete power for to helpe and rescow the cite / & put awaye the syege and gaue a stronge batayle / & Otta & his company defended them as well as they myght. But at ye last they were disco¯fyted / & the moost parte of them slayne / and Otta & Ossa were taken & put in prison at Lon don. And Vter hy¯selfe dwelled a whyle at Yorke / & after he went to Londe. And at Eester after he wolde bere crowne / & holde a solem ne feest / and let somon all his erles & barons / that they shold come to that feest / & all those that had wyues shold brynge them also to ye  eest. And all came at the kynges commaundement as they were commaumded. The feest was rychely arayed & holden / & all worthely set to meet after that they were of estate So yt the erle Gorloys of Corne wayle & Igreyne his wyfe sate nexte to ye kynge And whan the kynge sawe the fayrnes of that lady that she had / anone he was rauysshed for her beaute / & ofre he made to her nyce countenaumce in lokynge and laughynge. So at the last the erle perceyued the preuy lokynge & laughynge and the loue bytwene them / and rose up from ye table in wrath / & toke his wyfe / and called to hym his knightes / & went thens all in wrath wtout takyng leue of the kynge. The kynge anone sent after hym that he sholde come agayn & go not thens in despyte of hy¯. And ye erle wolde not come agayne in no maner of wyse. Wherfore the kynge was full wroth / & in wrath hym defyed as his deedly cu my.   And ye erle went thens in to Cornewayle with his wyfe in to the castell of Tyntagell. And the kynge let ordeyne a grete hoost & came in to Cornewayle for to destroye the erle yf he myght. But he had put hym in y• stronge castell of Tyn tagell yt was well arayed / & wolde not yelde hym to ye kyng. And ye kyng anone besyeged the castell / & there dwelled .xv. days & might not spede / & euer thought vpon Igreyne / & vpon her layde so moche loue / that he wyst not what to do. So at y• last he called to hym a knyght yt was called Vlfin that was preuy with hym / & tolde hy¯ all his coumseyle / & asked of hym what was best to do. Syr sayd he / sende after Merlyn anone / for he can tell you the best coumseyle of ony man lyuynge. Merlyn anone was sent after & came to ye kyng. And the kyng told hym all his coumseyle and his wyll. Syr sayd Merlyn / I shall do so moche through ye crafte that I can / that I shal make you come to nyght in ye castell of Tyntagell / & shall haue all your wyll of that lady.  How kyng Vter begate on Igreyne that was the erles wyfe of Cornewayle Arthur kynge. MErlyn through crafte yt he coude chaunged y• kynges fygure in to the lykenes of the erle / & Vlfin Garloys his chamberleyn in to ye fygure of Iordan that was y• erles chamberleyn / so y• eche of them was transfigured to others lykenes. And whan Merlin had so done he sayd to the kynge. Syr sayd he / now may ye go sodeynly to ye castell of Tyntagell / & aske entre there and haue your wyll. The kyng toke pryuely all ye hoost to gouerne and lede to a knyght that he moche loued / & toke his waye towarde the castell / & with hym toke Vlfyn his chamberlayne and Merlyn. And whan they came thyder / y• porter wende it had ben his owne lord. And wham tyme came for to go to bedde / y• kyng went to bedde with Igreyne the erles wyfe / and dyd with her all his wyl / & begate vpon her a sone whiche was called Arthur. And on the morowe ye kyng toke his leue of ye lady and went agayn to his hoost. And the same nyght that the kynge laye by Igreyne in bedde yt was the erles wyfe the kynges men gaue a grete assaute to the castel. And the erle & his men manly defended them. But at the last it befel so that in the same assaute the erle hy¯selfe was slayne & the castell taken. And the kyng anone returned agayn to Tyntagell and spoused Igreyne with moche honour and made her quene. And soone after that the tyme came y• she sholde be delyuered & had a sone whiche was called Arthur. And after that gate on her a doughter that was called Amya. And whan she was of age a noble baron that was called Aloth y• was lorde of Leons wedded her.  Whan Vter longe tyme had regned there came vpon hy¯ a grete sekenes as it were a sorowe. And in the meane tyme those that had in kepynge Otta that was Engistes sone and Ossa his broder that than were in pryson / they let them goo for grete gyftes that they gaue / and wente with them. And whan these two bretherne were escaped & came agayne in to theyr owne coumtree they ordeyned a grete power of folke / & began to warre agayn vpon the kyng.  How kynge Vter chose Aloth to kepe the londe of Brytayne whyle yt he was seke / for as moche as he myght not for his sekenes. ANd for as moche as kyng Vter was seke & myght not helpe hy¯ selfe / he ordeyned Aloth sone of Eleyne that than was chosen for to be wardeyn   and  heftayne of all his folke. And so he anone & his Brytons assembled a grete hoost / & gaue batayle to Otta and to his folke / but Otta at the last was discomfyted.  It be fell thus after warde that these brytons had indignacyon of Aloth & wolde not be to hym attendaumt / wher fore y• kynge was wonders fore anoyed and let put hym in a lyttet is the hoost amonge his folke. And they ladde hym to Vero oin that than was a fayre cite / where as saynt Albon was martyred / and after was that cite destroyed with paynyms & through warre / and thyder they had sent Otta & Ossa & theyr people & entred in to ye towne & let make fast the gates / & there they helde them. And the king came & besyeged them / & made a stronge assaute. But they y• were win manly defended them. The kyng let ordeyn his go¯nes & his engynes for to breke y• walles / & y• walles were so stronge y• no thynge myght misdo the¯. Otta & his people had grete despite y• a kyng lyenge in a lytter had besteged them / & toke coum seyle to come out on ye morow & gyue batayle to ye king / & in that batayle Otta & Ossa were slayne / & al ye other alyue fled in to Scotlonde / & made Colegrin theyr cheftayne. And ye saxons y• were escaped brought agayn a grete strength / & sayd amonge them / yf kyng Vter were deed they shold well co¯quere ye lo¯d / & thought to poyson hy¯ / & ordeyned men to do this dede: gyuyng them grete gyftes / & they went thyderward in poore mennes wede to accomplysshe theyr fals purpose / but it auayled not / for they myght not come nygh y• kyng. Tyll at ye last they espyed that ye kyng dra¯ke none other ly our but water of a clere well y• was nigh besyde & these traytours on a day priuely went to ye well & put therin poyson so yt al the water was poysoned / & anone after a  the kyng had dronken of y• water / he began to swell / & soone after dyed / & as many as dranke of y• water dyed also. And anone as this was espyed / folke of the towne let stop y• well for euermore. Wham the kyng was deed / his folke bare hy¯ to Stonehenge wt grete solempnite of bysshops & barons y• were there to bury hy¯ besyde Aurilambros his broder / & after returned agayn euerythone / & sent after Arthur his sone: & they made hym king of the londe with moche reuerence after his faders deth .xvij. yere of his regne.  How Arthur yt was the sone of Vte  was crowned after his faders dethe / & how he droue out of this londe Coleg  & the saxons / & Cheldrik of Aimayne.   WHan Arthur was made kynge of the londe he was but yonge of .xv. yere of age / but he was fayre and bolde and doughty of body / & to meke folke he was good and curteys and large of spendynge / and made hym wondersly well beloued among all men where it was nede. And wham he began to regne he sware that the saxons neuer   showe haue peas ne test tyll he had dryuen them out of the londe / & assembled a grete hoost & fought with Colegrin / the whiche after the tyme y• Otta was deed the saxons maynteyned. And this Colegrin was disco¯fyted & fledde vnto yorke & toke the cite / & there helde hym. And ye kynge besyeged hym there / but he gate no thynge / it was so stronge / & y• cite defended it manly. In y• meane tyme Cole grin left y• cyte to Bladud & fled hymself to Cheldrik that was kyng of Almayne for to haue socour of hym. And he assembled a grete power & arryued in scotlond with .v .C. shyppes. And whan Arthur wyst of these tydynges / & sawe he had not folk ynough to fyght wt Cheldrik / he lefte ye syege & went to London / & sent anone lettres to Howell of lytell Brytayn his neuewe his systers sone / yt he sholde come to hym wt all ye power yt he myght. And he assembled a grete host & arryued at southampton / where king Arthur receyued hym Ioyously wt moche honour. And those two hostes mette & assembled them / & toke theyr waye to Nichol that Cheldrik had besyeged / but it was not taken. And they came vpon Cheldrik & his people or they wist where that they were / & assayled the¯ egerly. Kyng Cheldrik & his men defended them manly to theyr power. But kyng Arthur and his men slewe so many saxons y• neuer was seen such slaughter. And Cheldrik & his men yt were left alyue fledde away / and kyng Arthur pursued them & droue the¯ out in to a wode yt they myght no ferder passe. Cheldrik & his men sawe well that they were brought in to grete disease / & yelded them to kyng Arthur in this maner wise / that he shold take theyr horses & harneys & all yt they had / & they  wold  onely go on fote in to theyr shyppes / & so they  wold  go home in to theyr own lo¯de and neuer come agayn in to this londe. And vpon assuraumce of this thynge they gaue hym good host ages. And Arthur by counseyle of his men graunted this thynge / and receyued the hostages / and thervpon ye saxons went to theyr shyppes. And whan they were in the hye see the wynde chaumged as ye deuyll it wold and they turned theyr nauy and came agayne in to this londe and arryued at Cotnes / & went out of the shypp  and toke the loude / and clene robbed it / and slewe moche people / and toke all the armure that they myght fynde / & so they went forth tyll they came vnto Bathe. But the men of y• towne shette fast theyr gates / & wolde not suffre them to come within the towne / & they defended them well and manly agaynst them.  How king Arthur gaue batayle vnto the sarons whan they came agayne in to this londe / & had besyeged the towne of Bathe / and ouercame them. WHan kyng Arthur herde these tydynges / he anone let hange the hostages / & lefte Howell of Brytayn his neuewe for to kepe the marche to warde Scotlond with halfe his people / & hymselfe went to helpe & rescowe ye towne of Bathe. Whan he came thyder he gaue a stronge batayle to Cheldrik / & slewe almoost all ye people yt he had. For no man myght wtstande hym ne endure vnder ye stroke of his swerde / & there were slayne bothe Colegrin and Bladud his broder / and Cheldrik fledde thens &  wold  haue gone to his shyppes. But whan kynge Arthur wyst it / he toke .x. M. knyghtes to Cador that was erle of Cornewayle for to let & stop his passage. And Arthur hymselfe went toward y• marche of scot londe / for messengers told hym that the scottes had besyeged Howell of Britayn there as he ay seke / & therfore he hasted   hym thyderwarde. And Cador pursued after Cheldrik / & toke hym or he myght come to his shyppes / & slewe hym & his people. Whan Cador had done this viage / he hasted hym agayne towarde Arthur as fast as he myght / & foumde hym in Scotlonde / where he had rescowed Howell of Brytayne. But the Scottes were ferre within Mountef / and there they helde them a whyle / but Arthur pursued them / & they fledde thens in to Limoigne / there were in that coumtre .lx. yles / & grete plente of byrdes & Egles y• were wont to crye & fyght togyder and make grete noyse whan folke came to robbe that londe / and warne as moche as they myght / and so they dyd / for the Scottes were so grete rauenours / that they toke all that they myght fynde in the londe of Limoigne without ony sparynge / & therwith charged agayne the folke for to go in to Scotlonde.  How kynge Arthur asked of Merlyn the aduentures of .vj. of the last kynges that were to regne in Englonde / & how the londe sholde ende. SIr sayd Merlyn / in y• yere of the incarnacyon of Iesu Chryst. M .CC .xv. shall come a lambe out of Wynthestre that shall haue a whyte tongue & true lyppes / & he shall haue wryten in his hert holynes. This lambe shall make many goddes houses / & he shall haue peas ye moost parte of his lyfe / & he shall make one of ye fayrest places of ye worlde that in his tyme shall not fully be made an ende of. And in the ende of his lyfe a wolfe of a straumge londe shall do hy¯ moche harme & sorowe through warre / but at ye la¯be shall be mayster through helpe of a reed foxe that shall come out of the north west / & shall ouercome hym / & the wolfe shall dye in water. And after that tyme the lambe shal lyue no whyle but shal dye. His seed shal be in a straumge londe. And the londe shall be without a gouernour a lytell tyme. ANd after this tyme shall come a dragon medled with mercy and also with woodnes / and he shall haue a berde as a gote / that shall gyue in Englonde a shadowe / and shall kep  the lond from colde & hete / and his one fote shall be set in wyke / and that other in London / & he shall embrace in habytacyons And he shall open his mouth towarde wales / & the tremblynge of the hydour of his mouth his eeres shall stretche towarde many haby acyons & countrees & his breth shall be full swete in straumge londe. And in his tyme shall the ryuers renne blode & with brayne. And he shall make in places of his londe walles that shall do moche harme vnto his seed after his tyme. And than shall there come a people out of the Northwest durynge his regne / that shall be ladde through a wycked hare / that the dragon shall do crowne kyng / that afterwarde shall flee ouer the see / without comynge agayne for drede of ye dragon. And in that tyme the sonne shall be as reed as blode that men shall se through out all the worlde / that shall betoken grete pestylence and deth of folke / through dynt of swerde & that people shall be faderles tyll y• tyme that ye dragon dye through an hare that shal m ue warre agaynst hym vnto the ende of his lyf / that shall not fully be ended in his tyme. This dragon shall beholde in his tyme the best body of the worlde / and he shall dye besyde the marches of a straumge londe / & the londe shall dwell faderles without a good gouernour / and men shall wepe for his deth from the yle of Shepey vnto the hauen of Mar yl / wherfore alas shall be theyr   songe of faderlesse folke / that shall ouer lyue in his londe destroyed. ANd after this dragon shall come a gote out of Kar that shall haue hornes and a berde of syluer / and there shal come out of his nosethrilles a domp that shall betoken hungre & sorowe and grete dethe of the people. And moche of his londe in y• begynnynge of his regne shall be wasted. This gote shall go ouer in to Fraumce / & shall open y• floure of his lyfe & deth. In his tyme there shal aryse an Egle in Cornewayle that shall haue fethers of golde / that of pryde shall be wt out pere of the londe / & he shall despyse lordes of blode. And after he shal flee shamefully by a bere at Gauerscch. And after shal be made brydges of men vpon y• costes of the see / & stones shall fall from castelles / & many other townes shall be made playne. In this tyme shall seme yt the bere shall brenne / & a batayle shall be done vpon y• armes of y• see in a felde ordeined as a shelde / & at that batayle shal dye many whyte hedes / wherfore this batayle shall be called y• whyte batayle. And the foresayd bere shall do this gote moche harme / & it shall come out of the south west & of his blode. Than shal the gote lese moche of his londe / tyll y• tyme that shendshyp shall ouercome hy¯. And than shall he clothe hym in a lyons skyn & than shall he wynne that he had lost & more therto. For a people shall come out of the northwest y• shall make the gote so sore aferde yt he shall be in grete {per}plexite And he shall auenge hy¯ on his enemyes by the counseyle of two owles that fyrst shall be in peryll for to be vndone. But y• olde owle shall go away a certayn tyme and after he shall come agayn in to this lo¯de. These two owles shall do grete harme to many one / & so they shal coumseyle y• gote to arere warre agaynst y• foresayd bere. And at the last the gote & y• owles shall come at Burton vpom Trent / & shall go ouer / & for drede the bere shall flee & a swan wt hym fro his company to Burton towarde y• north / & there they shall be wt an harde shoure / & than shall the swanne be taken & slayne with sorowe / & y• bere taken & heded nexte vnto his nest y• shall stande vpon a broken brydge / on whom the sonne shall cast his bemes / & many shall hym seke for vertue that shal come from hym. In the same shall dye for sorowe & care a people of his londe / so that many londes shall be vpon hym y• more bolder afterward. And those two owles shall do moche harme to y• soresayd floure of lyfe / & shall lede her in to dystresse / so that she shall passe ouer the see in to fraumce for to make peas bytwene y• gote & the flourdelyce / & there she shall dwell tyll a tyme that her seed shall come and seche her / & they shall be styll tyll a tyme that they shall clothe them with grace / and they shall seche y• owles & put them to despytous dethe. And after shall this gote be brought to dysease & anguysshe / and in sorowe shall he lyue all his lyfe. AFter this gote shall come out of wyndsore a bore that shall haue an heed of a whyte lions hert / & piteous lokynge. His vysage shall be rest to seke men. His brest shal be staumchy¯g of thurst to y• thursty. his word shal be gospel. his herynge shall be meke as a lambe. In y• first yere of his regne he shal haue grete payne to iustyfye them that be vntrue. And in his tyme shall his lo¯de be multyplyed wt aliaumtes. And this bore thrugh fyersnes of his hert / shall make wolues to become lambes. And he shal be called through out the worlde / the bore of holynes / of fyersnes / of noblenes / & of mekenes. And he shall do mesurably all that he shall do vnto y• bourgh of Ierusalem   And he shall whette his tethe vpon the gates of Parys / and vpon foure londes Spayn shall tremble for drede. Gascoyn shall swete. In Fraumce he shall put his wynge. His grete tayle shall rest in Englonde softly. Almayne shal quake for drede of him. This bore shal gyue mantels to two townes of Englo¯de / & shal make the ryuer ren wt blode & brayne / & he shal make many medowes reed / & shall gete as moche as his auncesters dyd / & or he dye he shall bere thre crownes / & he shal put a lond in to grete subieccyon / & after it shal be recouered / but not in his tyme. This bore after he is deed for his dough tynes shal be buryed at Coleyn / and his londe shall than be replete of all good. AFter this bore shal come a lambe hauyng feet of leed / & an heed of brasse & a hert of a loppe / a swynes skyn and an hard. And in his tyme his londe shall be in peas ye fyrst yere of his regne He shal do make a cite yt all ye worlde shal speke of. This lambe shall lese through a wolfe a grete part of his londe / but he shall recouer it / & gyue a lordshyp to an egle of his lond / & this egle shal well gouerne it tyll pryde shall ouercome hym / alas y• sorowe / for he shall dye of his broders swerde. And after shall ye londe fall to the foresayd lambe / yt shall rule ye lo¯de in peas all his lyfe / & after he shal dye / & the londe shall be fulfylled wt all goodes. AFter this la¯be shall come a mold warpe / cursed of gods mouth / a caytyf / a coward / an hare. He shal haue an elderly skyn as a gote / & vengeaunce shall fall vpon hym for synne. The fyrst yere of his regne he shal haue of al good grete plente in his londe / and shall haue grete praysyng in his lond tyll y• tyme y• he shall suffre his people lyue into moche pryde wtout chastysynge / wherfore god wyll be wroth. Than shall aryse vp a dragon of the north that shal be full fyers / & shal meue warre agaynst y• moldwarpe gyuynge hym batayle on a stone. This dragon shal gadre in his company a wolfe comynge out of the west to meue warre agaynst the moldwarp in his syege / & so shal y• dragon & he bynde theyr tayles to gyder. Than shall come a lyon out of It londe yt shal fall in company with them / & than shall tremble ye londe yt shall be called englo¯de as an aspen lefe / & in y• tyme shall castels be kest down vpon Tamyse And it shal seme y• Seuerne shal be drye for the deed bodyes that shall fall therin The .iiij. chefe flodes in Englonde shall ren in blode / & grete drede shall be & anguysshe yt shal aryse. After ye moldwarp shall flee & ye dragon. The lyon & ye wolfe shall dryue them away / & the londe shall be wtout them. And the moldwarp shall haue no maner of power / saue onely a shyppe wherto he may go. And after yt he shall gyue ye thyrde parte of his londe to haue the fourth parte in rest & peas / & after he shall lyue in sorowe all his lyfe tyme. And in his tyme ye hote baths shal become colde. And after yt shall the moldwarp dye auenturously & sodemly / alas for sorowe / for he shall be drowned in a flode of the see. His seed shall become faderles in stran¯ge londes for euermore & than shall the lond be departed in to thre partes / yt is to say / to the wolfe / to ye dragon / & to ye lyon. And so shal it be for euer more. And than shall this londe be called the londe of conquest. And so shal ye tyght heyres of Englonde ende.  This same tyme that Merlin tolde to kyng Arthur of those kynges / Guillomer of Irlonde ordeyned a grete power of Irysshmen & arryued in Scotlonde fast by where as kyng Arthur lay wt his hoost.  How kyng Arthur fought wt Guillomer & ouercame hym. And how ye scottes became his men.   WHan Guillomer that was kyng of Irlonde herde tydinges that king Arthur was entred at Glastenbury / he ordeyned a grete power of Irysshmen & came to y• see wt them / & so came in to scotlond ouer y• see / & arryued fast by there as king Arthur was wt his hoost. And anone as he wyst therof / he went towardes hym & gaue hy¯ batayle & ouercame hym. And Guillomer fled wt his men agayn in to Irlonde. And wham this was done / Arthur returned agayn in to y• place where he had lefte y• scottes & wold haue slayne them all. But y• bysshops / abbots & other folke of y• coumtre & ladyes open heded come before kyng Arthur & cryed hy¯ mercy / sayenge. Gentyl kyng as ye are a mayntayner of christendom / haue pite on vs your euen chryste¯ / for by our deth ye gete no worship / as to slee chryste¯ folke / & therfore haue mercy on vs / for we haue had moche sorowe by the Saxons y• haue passed through our countree / but y• is not ynough to you / for they haue taken our castels & slayne out beestes & eten / & moch harme haue done vs / & yf ye slee vs cryenge you mercy / it sholde be grete dyshonour to you. For ye haue done ynough to vs / & haue ouercomen vs / & for goddes loue suffre vs to lyue & haue mercy on chryste¯ people y• byleue in Chryst as ye do. Whan kyng Arthur herd this sorowe / he had pite on them / & gaue them lyf & lymme wtout ony more harme / & they fell down to his feet & thanked hym / & became his lyege men / & he toke of them homage. And after y• kyng Arthur turned agayn wt his host & came to yorke / & there abode duryng y• vyage. And than gaue he al Logres to Aloth yt had spoused his syster / & plente of other gyftes. Than was Gawen his cosyn but yonge of age. To al his men y• had serued hym in his warre he gaue ryche gyftes thankynge them of theyr good seruyce.  How kyng Arthur spoused Gueneuer y• erles cosyn of Cornewayle / and after he conquered all Irlonde. WHan kynge Arthur had brought his londe in peas & rest & in good state / and all was well in euery coumtree. Than toke he & wedded a wyfe y• was called Gueneuer / & made her quene / a fayre lady & a gentyl / y• Cador y• erle of Cornewayle had nourysshed in his chambre yt was his cosyn. But neuer they had children togyder / & neuertheles king Arthur loued her full well. And anone as wynter was past / he let assemble a grete host and all his barons / & sayd that he  wold  go in to Irlonde for to conquere y• londe. And he taryed not longe y• he ne passed ouer in to Irlo¯de. And Guillomer y• king let assemble a grete host / & gaue batayle to kynge Arthur. But Guillomer was disco¯fyted and yelded hym to the kynge & became his man / & to hym dyd feaute & homage / & of hym helde all that londe   fro that tyme forward. And after passed kyng Arthur ferthermore and conquered Gutlonde & Islonde / & toke homage of y• folke of the londe / and there dwelled .xij. yere in peas / and regned with ioye and myrth / & there warred no man nor woman vpon hym. And he became so curteys & large & honourable / that the emperours courte of Rome / ne none other through out all y• worlde was not accounted to kyng Arthur y• ony man wyst of / nor none so well praysed. And therfore y• best knyghtes of all maner londes came vnto hym there for to dwell. And he receyued them wt good wyll & reuerence. And all the knyghtes were so good that no man knewe the werst. And therfore kynge Arthur made a roumde table / that whan they sholde syt at theyr meet / all sholde be lyke hye & euenly serued at the table / yt none of them sholde make vaunt that one were hyer than an other. And kyng Arthur had at that table brytons & frenshmen / norma¯s & flemynges / bur gonyons / mausers & lotherins / & of all the londes on this halfe the mount Gorye and of his londe of grete Brytayne / & of Cornewayle / of Wales / & of Irlonde / & of Scotlond / and shortly to tell of all the londes that wolde worshyp cheualrye suche came to kynge Arthurs courte.  How kyng Arthur went in to fraumce & conquered the londe of Froll that was a Romayne / & how he slewe hym. SIth it befell that kynge Arthur through coumseyle of his barons & lordes wolde go to conquere all Fraunce that than was called Galle through Romayns that than helde y• londe in theyr power & in theyr gouernaumce. And y• Romayns had taken that londe to a noble knyght and a worthy of body that was called Froll. And whan he wyst y• kyng Arthur came / he ordeyned an hoost of a grete power / & fought with the kynge / And he & his folke were dyscomfyted / & fledde vnto Parys & entred the cite / and closed the gates / and there helde hym. Wham Arthur wyst that Froll was gone to Parys / he pursued after & came thyder & besyeged hym. But the cite was stronge & well arayed / & they that were therin defended them well and manly. Kynge Arthur dwelled there more than a moneth / & there was so moche people in the cite y• they dispended all theyr vytayles y• they had wtin: & so grete hunger became amonge them y• they dyed wonders thycke within y• cite for hunger / & came vnto Froll / & prayed hym to be accorded wt kyng Arthur for to haue peas and they wolde yelde them vnto hym & the cite also. Froll saw that he might no longer holde the cite agaynst theyr wyll & trusted gretly vpon his owne strength & sent to kynge Arthur y• he sholde come fyght wt hym body for body / & so sholde they departe fraumce bytwene them two. Kyng Arthur anone graumted it / &   not that none of his people vndertoke y• batayle for hym. And on y•  orow bothe came well arayed wtout Parys / where as they shold fyght. And anone togyder they smote so fyersly / and so well they fought on bothe sydes / y• no man coude deme the better of them. And so it befell that Froll gaue Arthur suche a stroke y• he kneled to the groumde wheder he wold or not / & as Froll withdrewe his  erde he wounded kyng Arthur in the foreheed that y• blode fell downe by his eyen & his face. Arthur anone sterte vp egerly wham he felte hy¯selfe hurte as a man y• semed almoost wood / & he toke Tabourne his good swerde & drewe it vp on hygh / and gaue Froll suche a stroke y• therwith he claue his heed downe to y• sholders / so y• his heline myght not be his warent / &   so he fell down deed in ye place. And than they of ye cite made grete sorow for Froll And euerychone yelded them vnto kyng Arthur / & the towne also / & became his men / & dyd to hy¯ homage & feaute. And he receyued them / & toke of them good hostages. And kynge Arthur after that went forth wt his host & co¯ uered Angeo & Angiers / Gascoin / Poytou / Nauerne & Burgoyn / Berry / Lotherin / Turin / & Poytiers / & all ye other londes of fraumce he conquered holly. And wham he had all conquered & taken homage & feaute / he  turned agayn to Parys / & there dwelled he longe tyme / & ordeyned peas lo¯ge tyme ouer all ye coumtree & through out all fraumce. And whan peas was made ouer all through his noble knyghthode yt he had / & also for his own worthynes. And no man were he neuer so grete a lorde durst not meue warre agaynst hym neyther to aryse to make the londe of fraumce vnquyete. And in peas he dwelled there ix. yere / & did many grete wonders / & re proued many proude men & yll tyraumtes   chastised them after theyr deseruyng.  How kyng Arthur auaunted all his men that had trauayled in his seruyce. Nd afterwarde it befell thus at eester there as he helde a feest at Parys / & rychely he began to auaumce his knightes for theyr seruice that they had holpen hym in his conquest. He gaue to his stewarde yt was called Kay Angeo & Ang ers / & to Bedeler his butler he gaue Normandy that was called Neustrie And to Holdyn his chamberlayn he gaue Flaundres & Mance / & to Dorell his cosyn he gaue Boloyne / and to Rychard his neuewe he gaue Pountyf / and to all other he gaue large londes & fees after they were of estate. And whan Arthur had thus feffed his knyghtes / at Apryl nexte after folowynge he came agayn in to Britayn his owne londe / and after at whytsontyde nexte folowynge by counseyle of his barons he wol  be crowned kyng of Glomergon / & hel e a solempne feest / & let somon knyghtes / erles / & barons / that they sholde come thyder euerychone / & there was Scater kynge of scotlo¯de / Cadwere kyng of southwales Guillomer kyng of Northwales / Maded kyng of Irlonde / Malgamus kyng of Gutlonde / Achilles kyng of Islonde / Aloth kynge of Denmarke / Gonewas kyng of Norway / & Hell his cosyn kyng of Dorkeney / Cador kyng of lytell Brytayne / Morwith erle of Cornewayle / Mauran erle of Glocestre / Guerdon erle of winchestre / Bo l erle of Harford / Vrtegy erle of oxford / Cursal erle of Bathe Ionas erle of Chestre / Enerall erle of Dorchestre / Kymare erle of Salysbury Waloth erle of Caunterbury / Iugerne erle of Chichestre / Arall erle of Leicestre & ye erle of Warwyk / & many other moo ryche lordes.

Of the lettre that was sent from Rome for pryde to kynge Arthur. THe thyrde daye as kyng Arthur sate at his meet amo¯ge his kynges / & amonge them that sate at ye fee  before them came in .xij. men of age rychely arayed / & curteysly they salewed the kyng / & sayd they came from Rome sent as messengers fro the emperour / & toke to hym a lettre yt thus moche was to vnderstande. Gretely vs meruayleth Arthur that y• arte ones so hardy with   the eyen in thy heed to make open warre and contake agaynst vs of Rome / yt owe all ye worlde to deme / for y• hast neuer yet before this tyme proued ne assayed the strength of ye Romayns / & therfore thou it shall in a lytell tyme. For Iulius cesar conquered all ye londe of Brytayn / & toke therof truage / & our folke haue it longe had / & now through thy pryde y• withholdest it / wherfore we of Rome commaumde ye that y• yelde it agayne. And yet hast thou done more foly / that y• hast slayne Froll yt was our baron of Fraumce with wro¯ge / & therfore all ye comyns of Rome warneth the & commaumdeth the vpon lyfe & lym e / that y• in haste be at Rome for to make amendes of thy mysdedes that thou hast done.

Of the reuerence that kynge Arthur dyd to the emperours messengers. WHan this lettre was made &  sealed / kyng Arthur vnto th se messengers gaue grete gyftes / And after that ye messengers toke theyr leue & went  thens & came to the cour  of Rome agayne / & tolde the emperour how worthely they were receyued and also of the ryal company that he had for to serue hym / and how he was more  y ally serued than the emperour of Rome or ony other kyng lyuynge in ye worlde. And whan the emperour had ouers en the lettre / & had herde what was therin and sawe that Arthur wolde not be  uled after hym / he let assemble & ordeyne a grete hoost for to destroye kynge Arthur yf that he myght. And kynge Arthur as touchyng his power and party ordeyned his power & knyghtes of the rounde table.  Of the kynges and lordes that came for to helpe kynge Arthur agaynst the emperour. He kyng of Scotlond / of Irlond of Gutlonde / of Denmarke / & of Almayne / eche of them had .x. M. me  / the duke of Normandy / Gascoyn / Flaumdres / Poytou / and of Boloyne / eche had foure thousand. Gerin of Chartres had x. thousand. Howell of brytayn had .xij. thousande / & himselfe of his owne londe xij. thousand. And of arbalastres and of archers & of other folke on fote / that no man coude nombre them. And whan all were redy for to go / kynge Arthur toke his londe & Gueneuer his wyfe to kepe to one of his neuewes that was a wyse knight and a hardy whiche was called Mordred / but he was not all true / as ye shall here afterwarde. Kynge Arthur toke all his realme to this Mordred / saue onely the crowne. And after yt kynge Arthur toke his hoost & went to South hamton where that the shyppes were brought & the folke assembled / and they went vnto the see / and had wynde and weder at wyll. And as soone as they myght they arryued at Ha et / and as shortly as they coude they went a londe out of theyr shyppes / and spradde ouer all the countree.  How kyng Arthur fought wt a gyaumt in Spayne that was called Dinabus yt slewe Eleyue that was kynge Howels cosyn of lytell Brytayne. BYnge Arthur had not dwelled in the coumtree but a lytell tyme that men tolde hym that there was comen a grete gyaunte in to Spayne / and had rauysshed fayre Eleyne that was cosyn vnto Howell of lytell Brytayn / and had brought her vpon an hyll that is called the mount of saynt Bernarde / and there was no man in that coumtree so bolde nor so hardy that durst fyght with hym / ne come nye the place where as the gyaumt dwelled that was called Dinabus / and moche sorowe he dyd in that countree. Whan kyng Arthur herde these tydynges / he called to hym Kay & Bedewere and commaunded them for to go pryuely and espye where the gyaunt myght be foumde. And they came to ye ryuage there as men sholde go to the mount that was all enclosed aboute with water / & yet is and euer shall be. And they sawe a brennynge fyre vpon ye hyll. And there was also an other hyll nye that / & there was vpon that an other fyre bre¯nynge. Kay and Bedewere came to the nexte hyll / & founde a wydowe open heded / syttynge besyde a tombe sore wepyng / and made grete sorow / & ofte she sayd Eleyn Eleyn And Kay & Bedewere asked what she was / and wherfore she made so moche sorow / & who lay in that tombe. O sayd she / what sorowe & mysauenture fayre lordes seke ye here / for yf ye gyaunt may fynde you here / he wyll slee you anone. Be styll good wyfe sayd they / therof dismay you not / but tell vs the sothe why that thou makest so moche sorowe and wepynge. Syrs sayd she / for a damoysell that I nourysshed with my brestes that was called Eleyn / that was cosyn to Howell of Brytayn. And here lyeth ye body in this tombe whiche to me was taken to nourysshe. And so there came a deuyll a gyaunt and rauysshed her / and me also / and ladde vs bothe with hym away. And he wolde haue forlayn that mayde that was so yonge and tender of age / but she myght not suffre it / so grete and so huge as the gyaumt was. And for certayne yf he come now as he is wont to do / he wyll you now bothe  lee / & ther fore go ye hens. Than spake these two messengers and sayd to her / wherfore go ye not from hens. Certes syrs sayd she whan that Eleyn was deed / the gya  made me to abyde to do and haunte his   wyll /   I must it   suffre / & god it w teth I do it not with my wyll / for I had  euer to be deed than to deale wt him so moche payne & sorowe I haue whan he me forlyeth. Whan Kay & Bedewere had herde all yt this woman tolde them they returned agayne & came to kynge Arthur / & tolde hym all yt they had seen & herde. Arthur anone toke them bothe with hym and went pryuely by nyght that none of his hoost wyst / & came on ye morow erly to ye gyaumt & faught wt hym strongly / & at ye last slewe hym. And Arthur  ad Bedewere to smyte of his heed & brynge it in to the hoost to shewe it for a wonder / for it was so grete and huge. Whan they came agayn to ye hoste / they told wherfore they had be¯ out / & shewed to them the heed. And euery man was glad & ioyfull of the worthy dede yt kyng Arthur had done that was theyr lorde. And Howell was full sorowfull for his cosyn that was so lost. And after warde whan he had space he let make a fayre chapell of our lady ouer Eleyns tombe.  How kynge Arthur gaue batayle to the emperour / in ye whiche batayle the emperour was slayne. ARthur & his people had tydynges that ye emperour had assembled a grete power / as well of sarasyns as of paynyms & chrysten men / wherof the nonbre was .lxxx. M. hors men / with fote men. Arthur & his people ordeyned fast forth in theyr waye toward ye empe rour & passed Normandy & Fraumce vnto Burgoyn / & wolde haue gone to ye hoost For men tolde hym that the emperours hoost wolde come to Lucie. The emperour & his hoost in ye begynnynge of August remeued from Rome / & came forth ryght the waye towarde ye hoost. Than came kyng Arthurs espyes & sayd / yf yt Arthur wolde he sholde fynde the emperour there fast by / but they sayd that ye emperour had so grete power wt hym of kynges of the londe of paynyms / & also chrysten people / that it were but foly to kyng Arthur to mete with them. For ye spyes tolde that the emperour had fyue or syxe men agaynst one of his. Kynge Arthur was bolde & hardy / and for no thynge hym dysmayed & sayd. Go we boldly in goddes name agaynst the Romayns that with them lede sarasyns & paynyms / that haue no maner trust in god / but onely vpon theyr strength. Go we now & seke them sharply in ye name of almyghty god / & slee we ye paynyms & chrysten men yt be agaynst vs wt them for to destroye chrysten men / & god shall helpe vs to ouercome them / for we haue the ryght opynyon / & therfore haue we trust in god / & do we so that ye enemyes that be to chrystendom & to god may be destroyed & ouercomen / & that men may recorde the worthynes of knyghthode. Wham kyng Arthur had thus sayd / they cryed all wt an hye voyce. God yt is fader almyghty worshypped be thy name wtout ende. amen. And graumt vs grace well for to do / & to destroye our enemyes that be agaynst chrystendome. In the name of ye fader / the sone / & ye holy ghost. amen. And god gyue hym neuer grace n  worshyp in the worlde / ne mercy of hym to haue / that this daye shall feynt well for to smite & egerly. And so they rode softly & ordeyned theyr wynges wel & wysely The emperour herde t ll that kyng Arthur & his folke were redy apparaylled for to fyght with him / & how they were comynge / he let ordeyue his wynges in the best maner yt he coud / & more trusted in his strength than in almyghty god / & that was seen afterwarde. For whan ye two hostes mette / the emperour lost. iiij of his men agaynst ou  of Arthurs / & so   many were slayne what on ye one party & what on that other / that it was grete pyte to wyte & beholde. In this batayle were slayne through kyng Arthurs .v. kynges of the paynyms & of other wonders moche people. And kyng Arthurs men fought so wel that the Romayns & paynyms had no more strength to with stande them than .xx. shepe agaynst .v. wolues. And so it befel yt in this batayle in the shoure that was wonders hard & longe duryng on that one syde & on that other / the emperour among them there was slayne / but there was no man that wyst for very sothe who hym slewe.  How king Arthur let bury his lordes & knyghtes that he had lost in ye batayle and how he sent the emperours body to Rome that there was slayne in batayle. WHan the romayns wyst that the emperour was deed / they for soke the felde / & the paynyms also And kyng Arthur chaced after them tyl it was nyght / & so many of them slewe that it was wonder to tell. And wham it was nyght kyng Arthur turned agayn & thanked god of his victory. And on the morowe he let loke & serche all the felde for his knyghtes yt he there lost / that is to saye Borel erle of maunt / Bedewer & kay / & Ligiers erle of Boloyn / Vrgety erle of Baar / Aloth erle of Wynchestre / Cursael erle of Chestre / and Holden erle of Flaumdres. These were ye grete lordes that king Arthur lost in yt batayle with other worthy knyghtes amonge them. And some he let bury in abbays by the coumtree / some he let be borne into theyr owne coumtree. And the emperours body he let take & put vpon a bere / & sent it to Rome / & sent to saye the Romayns that for Brytayn & Fraumce whiche he helde / other truage wolde he none paye. And yf they asked hym ony other truages / ryght suche truage he wold tham paye kyng Arthur let here kay to kenen his owne castell / & there buryed hym. And Ligier was borne to Boloyn where he was lorde. And Holden was borne in to Flaumdres / and there was buryed. And all the other he let bury with moche honour in abbays & in houses of relygyon in the countree there they were slayne. And kynge Arthur hymselfe soiourned that same yere in Burgoyne with his hoost / & thought yt same yere folowyuge to passe the mount of Ioye / and to haue gone to Rome for to take the cite / and to haue put the Romayns in subieccyon / but the wycked tyraunt Mordred letted hym / as after ye shall here.  How the traytour Mordred to whom kyng Arthur toke his lo¯de to kept & his castels / & he helde them agaynst hym. WHan kynge Arthur had taken to Mordred his realme to kepe / and was gone agaynst the emperour of Rome / & was passed ye see / Mordred anone toke homage & feaute of all them yt were in this londe / & wolde haue had the lo¯de to his owne vse / & toke castels all about and let them be arayed. And after this faisnes he dyd an other grete wronge / for agaynst the lawe of thrystendom he toke his own vncles wife as a traytour and ordeyned hym a grete host agayust kyng Arthurs comyng / to holde ye londe agaynst hym wt strength for euermore / and to slee kyng Arthur yf he myght / & sent by see & by londe / and let assemble paynyms & christen people. And he sent to saxons and to danes for to helpe hym And also Mordred sent to Cheldrik to do men come to hy¯ out of saxon / that was a worthy duke / & promised hym yf that he brought with hym moche people he   wolde gra e hym in herytage for euer more all the londe from beyonde Humber to scotlonde / & all the londe that Engist had of Vortygers gyste whan that he spoused his doughtcr. And Cheldrik came wt a grete strength & power of people And Mordred had assembled also on his halfe / that they had .xl. M. of stronge knyghtes whan that they had nede.  How king Arthur chaced yt traytour Mordred / & how he was slayne / & kyng Arthur Wounded to deth. THese tydynges came to kyng Arthur where as he was in Burguyn / & was therof sore anoyed / & toke all Fraumce to Howell for to kepe wt halfe of his men / & prayed hym to kepe it tyll he came agayn / for he hyselfe wolde go into Britayn / & auenge hym on the fals traytour Mordred / & went his waye & came to whytsand / & toke shyppyng wt his men / & a grete hoost of frenshmen / & arryued at Sandwyche. But or that he myght come to londe wt his people / Mordred was come wt all his power / & gaue a stronge batayle / so yt kyng Arthur lost many a man or he myght come to londe For there was Gawayne his neuewe slayne & Augnissell yt helde Scotlonde / & many other / wherof kyng Arthur was ful sory. But after yt they were comen to lo¯de / Mordred might not agaynst them endure / but was disco¯fyted & fled thens the same nyght wt his men / & on the morowe came to London / but men of ye cite wold not let hy¯ entre / & from thens fled to wynehestre / & there helde hym wt his people. Kyng Arthur let take ye body of Gawayn his cosyn / & ye body of Augnissel / & let yt one be borne to scotlond / & that other to Pouer & buried. And after king Arthur toke his waye to destroye Mordred / & he fled thens into Corne Wayle. And the quene Gueneuer yt was kynge Arthurs wyfe yt than soiourned at yorke herde that Mordred was fled thens / & yt he myght not endure agaynst kyng Arthur / she was sore aferde and had grete doubte / & wyst not what was best to do For she wyst well yt her lorde kynge Arthur wolde neuer of her haue mercy for the grete shame yt she had done hy¯ / & toke her waye pryuely with .iiij. men & no mo / & came to Karlyon / & there she dwelled all her lyfe / & was neuer seen amo¯ge folke. Kyng Arthur wyst that Mordred was fledde in to Cornewayle / & let send after his men in to Scotlond & Northumberlonde vnto Number / and let assemble folke wtout nombre & went vnto Cornewayle to seke Mordred. And Mordred had assembled to hy¯ all yt folke of Cornewayle without nonbre / & wyst yt Arthur was comynge / & had leuer to dye & take his chaumce than longer to flee / & abode & gaue an hard batayle to kyng Arthur & his people: so yt there escaped none away on lyue saue kynge Arthur & other that were wounded to deth / for Mordred was slayne & all his people / and all kyng Arthurs noble knyghtes of ye roumde table / wherof it was grete pyte. And king Arthurs made hym to be borne in a lytter to Auyon to be heled of his woundes. And yet ye Brytons suppose yt he lyueth in an other lond / & that he shall come yet & conquere all Brytayn. But cer es this is ye prophecy of Merlyn. He sayd his dethe shold be doubtous / & he sayd trouth. For therof yet men haue doubte / & shal haue for euermore as men saye. For men wote not whether that he is on lyue or deed.  Arthur was borne to Auyon the. xxii yere of his regne / after the incarnacyon of our lorde Jesu Chryst .v. C .xlvi. yere.  How kynge Arthur delyuered the realme vnto Constantyne the sone of Cador his neuewe.   WHan kyng Arthur wyst that he myght regne no lenger / he let come before hy¯ Constantyne that was Cadors sone erle of Cornewayl his cosyn / and to hym betoke all his realme byddynge hym to be kynge therof tyll that he came agayne / for as moche as he had none heyre begoten of his body / and grete harme it was / that so noble a kyng and so doughty as he was had no childe of his body begote¯. But all thy¯ge that god wyll haue done / must be done / whose name be blyssed wtout ende. amen.  How Constantyne slewe Mordreds two sones that warred vpon hym. THis Constantyne was a noble & a worthy knyght of body. And yt two sones that Mordred had begoten had grete enuy vnto Constantyne that than was crowned kynge. And so it befell yt they began to meue warre agaynst hym / & assembled a grete hoost of them that were before with Mordred / & had ben dryuen awaye / whiche dyd moche sorowe through out all the londe. That one broder ordeyned hy¯ to go to London for to take the cite / & that other went to wynchestre. But Constantyne came to London and slewe hym that was there And after he went to wynch estre¯ & sleme hym that was there also. And so was he quyte of bothe his enemyes. Whan Constantyne had regued well & worthely foure yere he dyed / & lyeth at London.  Of kynge Adclbryghe and of kynge Edell. AFter kynge Constantynes deth there were two kynges in Brytayne / that one was called Adtlbryght that was a Dane / & he helde the coumtree of Norfolke and Suffolke. That other hyght Edell and was a bryton / and he helde Nicholl / Lyndesey / & all the londe vnto Number. These two kynges fast warred togyder / but they were after accorded / & loued togyder as they had ben borne of one body. The kyng Edell had a syster that was called Orewenne / and he gaue her through grete frendshyp to kynge Adelbryght to wyfe. And kynge Adelbryght begate vpom her a doughter that was called Argentyl. And yt thyrde yere after came vpon hym a straumge sekenes that nedes he must dye. And he sent to kynge Edell his broder in lawe that he sholde come & speke with hym / and he came to hym with a good wyll. Than prayed he the kyng and coniured hym also in the name of god / that after whan he were deed / he sholde take his doughter Argentyll & the londe / & kepe and nourysshe her in his chambre. And whan she were of age that he shold mary her to the strongest & worthyest man that he myght fynde / and than he shold yelde vp her londe agayne. Kyng Edell graunted it / and by othe confermed his prayer. And wham Adelbright was deed & buryed / Edell toke yt damoysell Argentyll / & nourysshen her in his chambre / & she became as fayre as ony myght be.  How kyng Edell maryed the damoysell to a knaue of his kerhym. THis kyng Edell that was vncle to Argent yit / bet hought how he might falsly haue ye londe from his nece / & falsly agaynst his othe to deceyue ye damoysell / & to mary her to a knaue of his kechin yt was called Curan / & he became the worthyest & strongest man of body yt ony man wyst in ony londe lyuyng / & to him he thought shamefully to haue maryed her for to haue had her londe afterwarde / but he was deceyued. For this Curan was Haueloks sone yt was king of kyrklane in De¯marke / & this Curan to¯quered his wyues londe afterward / & slewe king Edel yt was his wyues vncle & had all her lond / as in an other place it telleth more openly: & he regned but thre yere / for saxons & danes slewe hym / & yt was grete harme to all Brytayn / & the brytons bare hym to Stonehenge / and there buryed hym honourably.  Of king Conan yt was Curans cosin. AFter this Curan regned Conan his cosyn / a proude knyght / & he regned wtout loue / & euer was medlyng wt his people / & toke his vncle wt warre sleynge his two children. The Saxons warred agaynst hy¯ oftentymes / but he ouercame them / & so he was in peas all his lyftyme / & he regned .xiiij. yere / & after he dyed & lyeth at London.  Of kyng Cortyf & Gurmond yt came through the paynyms in to Brytayne. AFter this Conan regned his cosyn Cortyf / yt was behated of all his people / & this Cortyf lost all britayn through warre / & in his tyme fel yt grete myschefe in brytayn yt thryste¯dom was destroyed / & all ye brytons were wyuen out of ye londe / but afterward lefte   to the saxons / as afterward ye shal here For in that tyme there was a paynym that was called Gurmond ye ky¯ges sone Daufrikes of ye paynyms folke / &  shold  haue ben kynge after his fader / but he gaue it to his broder / & sayd he wold be no kynge tyll he had conquered a realme in a straumge coumtree. And of hym prophe cyed Merlyn / callynge him a wolfe of ye see. And he let assemble paynyms wtout nomrbe & shyppes. And goynge by ye see he conquered dyuers londes / takyng he mage of many. And he came in Irionde & conquered it / that oftentymes warred vpon brytons / & brytons vpon them / & ofte wonne & oft lost / & gaue hostages to brytons. And so they sente to Gurmond there as he was in Irlonde / yt he sholde come & helpe them agaynst yt brytons / & they wold gladly make hym theyr lord. For he was a paynim / & they were paynyms / and the brytons were chrysten. Whan Gurmond herde this / he hasted hym & arryued in scotlonde / & came in to Northumberlond where as the saxons were dwellyng / & they co¯fermed yt couenaumtes bytwene them made by othes & hostages / for to bere hym true fayth / & holde hym forlorde / & paye to hy¯ truage by yere. Than began yt saxons & the affricans to destroye / robbe & brenne to wnes / & destroyed all maner thynge / sparyng neyther man / woman / ne chylde / lerned nelewde / but slewe all / & kest downe townes / castels & chirches / & so put yt londe to grete destruceyon. And as soone as they myght flee they fledde thens as well poore as ryche / bysshops & men of religyon / grete & small / some in to lytell Britayn / & some in to Cornewayle / and all those that myght haue shyppes.  How kynge Gurmonde droue kynge Cortif to chuhestre / & slewe the britons and through subtylte gate the towne.   COrtyf the kyng fledde thens in to Chichestre that than was a good cite and a stronge / & there helde hym .xx. dayes. And this Gurmond came and be syeged it. But y• cite was so stronge y• he myght not gete it by no maner of wyse / wherfore they thought by subtylte to brenne the towne / they made engynes with glewe of nettes / and toke peces of tunder & fyre & boumde it to sparowes feet and afterwarde let them flee / and they anone ryght flewe in to the towne there as theyr nestes were / in thackes and in euyssynges of houses / & the fyre began to kyndle & brent all the towne. Whan y• brytons sawe that / they hyed them out & fought / but anone they were slayne & discomfyted / & whyle the batayle duted the kynge all in despayre pryuely went in to wales / so y• men wist not where he became. And so was the towne of Chichestre taken & destroyed. And after Gurmond went & destroyed townes & citees that neuer after were made again / as it is seen yet in this lo¯de in many places. How this londe was called Englo¯de for the name of Engist / and how many kynges were made after in this londe. WHan Gurmond had destroyed all the londe through out / he gaue y• londe to the saxons / & anone they toke it with good wyll. For y• saxons longe tyme had desyred it / for as moche as they were of Engistes kynrede / that first had all y• londe of Brytayn / & let them be called englyshmen / for bycause of Engistes name. And y• londe they let call Englond in theyr language / & the folke ben called Englyshmen / for as moche as in his tyme it was called Engist londe whan he had conquered it of Vortiger. But fro the tyme y• Brute came fyrst in to this londe it was called Britayn / & y• folke brytons But syth y• tyme y• Gurmond conquered this londe y• saxons named it Englonde as before is sayd. And whan this was done / Gurmo¯d passed ouer in to fraumce & there conquered many lo¯des / & destroyed all chrysten people where as he came. And the saxons dwelled in this londe / & began fast to enhabyte it at theyr owne wyll / & they wold haue made newe kyn ges & lordes / but they coude neuer assent to haue onely one kyng for to be to them attendaumt / & therfore they made many kynges in dyuers shyres / as it was in Engistes tyme. The fyrst kyngdon was Kent / & that other Southsex / & y• thyrde westsex / the fourth Estsex / and the fyfth Northumberlo¯de / the syxth Estangle / y• is to saye Norfolk & Suffolk / & the .vij. Merchenrich / & that is y¯ erledom of Ni choll / Huntyngdon / Harford / Glo estre / wynchestre / warwyk & Derby / & so departed all Englo¯d in to .vij. partes. And after that it befell y• tho kynges warred often tymes togyder. And euer he y• was strongest toke hym y• was feblest / & so it was longe tyme that they had no kyng   crowned amonge them / nor no chrysten man was than amonge them ne christen dom neyther. But were paynyms tyll y• saynt Gregory was pope of Rome / that had seen children of y• nacion of Englo¯de in y• cite of Rome y• were wonders fayre creatures / & had grete wyll & desyre to beholde them / & asked of y• marchaumtes of whens they were & of what nacyon. And men tolde hym they were of Englonde / & englysshe they were called / but they & all y• people of englond were paynyms / & byleued not on god. Alas sayd saynt Gregory / well may they be called englysshe / for they haue y• visages of aum gels / and therfore well ought they to be christen. And for this cause saynt Grego ry sent saynt Austin in to englonde / & .xl. good men wt hym that were of good lyfe & holy men to preche & teche / & to co¯uerte the englysshe people / & turne the¯ to god / & y• was in the .vj. yere y• saynt Gregory had ben pope of Rome / y• is to saye / after the incarnacyon of our lord Iesu Chryst v .C .lxxxv. yere as y• cronycles telleth. How saynt Austyn baptysed & co¯uerted kyng Adelbryght / and the bysshops that he made his felawes. WHan saynt Austin came fyrst in to englonde / he arryued in the yle of Tenet / & so passed forth & came to Caun terbury / and there soiourned. And kyng Adelbryght of Kent y• was of y• lignage of Engist goodly receyued saynt Austyn & his felawes wt moche honour / & foumde them all y• them neded. And more ouer he gaue them a fayre place / y• now is cal led the abbey of saynt Austin / in whiche place helyeth hymself shryned.  This kynge Adelbryght was a good man / & with good wyll herd saynt Austyns pre dicacyons / and gaue hym leue to preche through out al his lo¯de of Kent to turne and co¯uerte to hym all y• people that he myght. It befell so afterward through goddes grace / y• in a lytell tyme y• kynge hymselfe was co¯uerted to god / & all the people of his londe was baptysed. And in y• meane whyle y• people turned them to god / saynt Austyn came to Rochestre & there preched the worde of god / & the paynyms scorned hym therfore / & cast vpon hym reygh tayles / so that all his mantell was hanged full of those reygn tayles / & for more despite they cast on hy¯ the guttes of reyghes and other fysshe. Wherfore y• good ma¯ saynt Austin was sore anoyed & greued / & prayed to god y• all those children of y• cite that sholde be borne afterward / y• is to saye / in the cite of Rochestre myght haue tayles / and so they had. Whan the kyng herde of this vengeaumce y• was fallen through saynt Austins prayer / he let make a hous in y• honour of almyghty god / wherin women shold be delyuered of theyr children at the brydges ende / in the which bous yet women of the cite ben delyuered of chylde. Whan saynt Gregory had herde tell how the englysshe people were turned to god & co¯uerted / he sent vnto saynt Austyn his pallyon by a bysshop y• was called Paulyn / and made hym prymate and archebysshop of Englonde and sent worde that he sholde ordeyne and make bysshoppes in the londe. And anone as saynt Austyn had the pallyon of the dignite of the archebysshop / he made two bysshoppes of his felawes the whiche came with hym from Rome / of whome that one was called Mellyte / & he helde his dignite at London / and that other was called Iustyne / and he helde his dignite at Rochestre. And this bysshop Mellyte than went to preche the worde of god in Essex / and there baptysed the kynge of y• countree whiche was called Sicwith y• was kyng Adelbryghtes to   syn his systers sone. This Iustyn went to preche in Southsex / & turned moche of the people to god / & saynt Austin him selfe preched through out all Englonde. How saynt Austyn went in to wales where as the Brytons were / and how they wolde not be obedyent to the arche bysshop of Caunterbury. WHan all Englo¯de was baptysed and turned to god / saynt Austin went in to y• londe where as the brytons were to kepe them from englyssh men / that is to saye in wales / & there he foumde monkes & abbeys / & .vij. bisshops For the brytons destroyed alway y• chry sten people y• saynt Austyn had co¯uerted And he sayd to the bisshops that he was a legate of Rome / & prymate of all Englonde / & that they sholde by all reason to hym be obedyent. And they sayd y• they wolde not / but to y• archebysshop of Car lyon they wolde / they wold neuer for no maner thinge be obedyent to y• englyssh men. For they sayd / englysshmen be our aduersaryes / and haue dryuen vs out of our coumtree / & we ben chrysten men and euer haue ben / & the englysshmen haue euer be¯ paynyms / saue now of late that they be co¯uerted. Saynt Austyn might of them haue none other answere / but sayd pertly that they wolde neuer meke them to hym ne to the pope of Rome. Wherfore saynt Austin returned agayn to king Adelbryght y• was king of Kent & tolde him y• his folke wold not be to no man obedyent / but to y• archebysshop of Carlyon. Whan the king herde this / he was sore anoyed / & sayd that he wolde destroye them / & sent to Elfryde kyng of Northumberlonde y• was his frende / y• he shold come to hym wt all y• power that he myght / & he wold mete hym at Leycestre / and fro thens they wolde go in to wales / & there destroye y• archebysshop of Carlyon / and all those that had refused saynt Austyn. How kyng Adelbryght & kyng Elfry de slewe Brecynall y• was a kyng of bry tons that helde y• coumtree of Leycestre. IT befell so that there was a kyng of brytons that helde the coumtre of Leycestre / & all the countre aboute / his name was Brecynall. And this bryton herde tell y• those two englysshe kynges wolde mete there at Leycestre for to go in to wales / he let ordeyne all the power that he had for to go fyght wt these two ky¯ges / but lytel it auayled hym / for his folke were all slayne / & hymself fledde / & lost his londes for euermore. And these two ky¯ges Adelbryght & Elfryde dwel led a whyle at Leycestre / & departed the londe amonge them / and toke homage & feaute of the folke of y• coumtree. And af ter they went toward wales. And they of wales herde tell of y• disco¯fyture that Brecmal had at Leycestre / & were won ders sore adrad of those two kynges / & toke & chose amo¯ge them good men & ho ly / of heremytes / mo¯kes & preestes / & of other people grete plente / y• wente bare fote and wolwarde for to haue mercy of those two kynges. But y• kynges were so sterne & so wycked y• they  wold  neuer speke wt them / but slewe them all. Alas for sorowe / for they ne spared them no more than the wolfe doth the shepe / but smote of theyr hedes euerichone. And so they were all martyred y• to them came that is to vnderstande .v .C. and .xl. And after they wente fro thens to Bangore for to slee all those y• they myght fynde there of y• brytons. And whan y• britons herde that / they assembled & ordeyned all theyr power for to fyght with them. Than was there a baron of wales whi che was called Bledrik of Cornewayle   that somtyme was lorde of Deenshyre / but king Adelbright had dryuen hy¯ out in to wales / & after there he gaue them batayle / & at y• batayle was kyng Adelbryght slayne / & Elfryde sore wounded / & forsoke y• felde / & the moost parte of his people slayne. And king Elfryd fled in to Northumberlond y• was his owne lo¯de And after the people of Leycestreshyre made wt strength Cadewan y• was Brecinals sone kyng of Leycestre / & he after regned nobly / & with grete honour. How Cadewan kynge of Leycestre & Elfryde king of Northumberlond were frendes. And of the debate y• after was bytwene Edwyn and Cadwalyn that were bothe theyr sones. AFter that this bataile was done the britons assembled them and went thens & came to Leicestre / & made there Cadewan y• was Br ynals sone kyng of Leycestre & of all y• coumtree. And he toke homage & feaute of all y• folke of the coumtree. And after that he assembled a grete hoost / and sayd he wolde go in to Northumberlonde to destroye kyng Elfryde & slec hym yf he myght. And wham he was comen thyder / frendes went so bytwene them that they accorded them in this maner. That Elfryde shold  hold  all y• londe from Humber vnto scotlonde and Cadewan sholde haue all y• londe on this syde Humber to y• south. And after that they were good frendes all theyr lyf / & loued togyder as they had ben bre therne. And this Elfryde had a sone called Edwyn y• helde all y•  ond of North berlonde after his faders deth as his fa der had hold al his lyfe tyme. And Cade wan had another sone called Cadwa  that helde his faders londe as he   wham he was alyue / & these loued as bre therne / & the loue insted bytwene them but onely two yere / & after began debate bytwene them thrugh an euyl enuyous cosyn of Cadwalyns called Bryens / so y• they assembled a grete host on bothe par tyes. And at y• last it befell y• Cadwalyn was disco¯fyted / & Edwyn pursued him and droue hym from place to place / so y• at the lasthe fled in to Irlo¯de. And Edwyn destroyed his londe / & cast downe castels & brent his maners / & departed all Cad walyns londe among his frendes. And lo¯ge tyme after came Cadwalyn agayn from Irlonde with a stronge power / & in playne batayle slewe Edwyn and all his frendes / & namely them that withhelde his londes by Edwyns gyfte. How kynge Oswalde was slayne by kynge Cadwalyn & Peanda. And how Oswy that was saynt Oswaldes broder regned after hym / & slewe Peanda. WHan Edwyn was slayne Offris his sone vndertoke the warre agaynst Cadwalin his vncle / so that this Offris dyed duryng y• warre. And after the deth of Offris regned a gentyl chrysten man that moche lo¯ued god almygh ty / that had all y• londe of Northumberlonde by herytage y• was called O ald & he was kyng of all y• londe. But for as moche as he was frende to Edwin and helde a grete parte of y• londe of Cadwa lyn. This Cadwalyn warred vpon him and droue hym towarde scotlonde. And whan Cadwalyn sawe that he wold not abyde / he wolde no longer pursue hym / but toke some of his folk to Peanda his broder in lawe / & prayed hym to pursue after Oswald tyll that he were taken or slayne. And Cadwalyn returned home agayn. Whan Oswald herd y•  ydy¯ges that Cadwalin turned home agayn / he wolde no longer flee / but abode Peanda & gaue hym batayle / & Peanda was dis comfyted & fled & came agayn to Cadwa lyn / & sayd y• wolde neuer holde a fote of   londe of hym / but yf so were y• he wolde auenge hym on Oswald. Cadwalyn let assemble a grete hoost for to fyght with Oswald / so that he and Peanda came to Northumberlonde & gaue batayle vnto Oswald / & in y• same batayle was Oswald slayne & his heed smyttenof / & after he was buryed in y• abbey of Bardeney / in whiche place god hath wrought for hym many a fayre myracle / bothe there and els where. And anone Oswy his broder seased all the londe in to his handes y• was this Oswaldes. And the folke of Northumberlond loued hym won ders well / & helde hym for theyr lorde: But he had men of his kynne worthy ynough y• wolde haue departed y• londe & they warred lo¯ge togyder. And for as moche as they were not stronge ynough they came to Pcanda & prayed hym of helpe & socour / & pmysed hym of y• londe largely vpon this couenaumt / y• he wolde gouerne them & helpe & coumseyle. Peauda herde theyr prayer / & so spake wt king Cadwalyn / that he shold ordeyn a grete hoost / & fast ordeyn hym in to Northum berlonde for to fyght with Oswy. And Oswy was a mekeman & moche loued peas & charite / & prayed Peanda of loue & peas / & profred hym of golde & syluer grete plente. And this Peanda was so proude y• he wolde not graumte hym peas for no maner thynge / but for all thynge he wolde fyght with hym. So at y• last there was set a day of batayle / & Oswy euer had trust vpon god / & Peanda trusted to moche vpon his pryde and vpon his hoost that he had / and togyder they smote egerly. But Peanda was anone discomfyted & flayne. And this was after the incarnacion of our sauyour  esu Chryst. vj .C. and .lv. yere. And this Oswy regned .xxviij. yere / & a kynge that was called Oswyne that was Peandaes cosyn warred vpon hym / and togyder they fought / but Oswy had the victory of Oswyne / & was discomfyted and slayne / and lyeth at Cynmouth.  How kynge Cadwaldre y• was Cadwalins sone regned after his fader / and was the last kynge of Brytons. AFter y• deth of Cadwalin regned his sone Cadwaldre well & nobly / & his moder was y• sister of Peanda And wham he had regned .xij. yere he fell in to a grete sekenes / & than was there a grete discorde bytwene the lordes of y• londe / that eche warred vpom other. And yet in that tyme there fell so grete derth and scarcete of corne & other vytayles in this londe y• a man myght go .iij. or .iiij. dayes fro towne to towne that he sholde not fynde to bye for golde ne syluer breed wyne / ne none other vytayle / wherwt a man myght lyue. But onely the people lyued by rotes of herbes / for other lyuynge had they none / so moche was it fayled all about / fysshes / wylde beestes & all other thynge / so y• yet to this mysauenture there fell so grete mortalyte & pestilence amonge the people by the corrupcyon of y• deed bodyes. For they dyed so sodeinly / both grete & small lorde & seruaumt in etynge / goynge & spe kyng / they fell downe & dyed / so y• neuer was herde of more sodeyn deth amonge the people. For he y• went for to bury the deed body / with y• same deed body was buryed. And so they y• myght flee fledde & forsoke theyr londes & houses / as well for the grete hunger / derth / & scarcete of corne & other vytayle / as for y• grete mor talite & pestylence in the londe / & went in to other londes for to saue theyrlyues / & lefte y• londe all deserte & wasted / so that there was no man for to trauayle & tyll the loude / so that y• loude was  a ayne   of corne & all other fruytes for define of tillers / & this misaue¯ture duted .xj. yere & more / y• no man myght ere ne sowe.  How Cadwaldre went out of this londe in to lytell Brytayne. CAdwaldre sawe grete hunger / mortalite & pestilence / & the londe all poore / & faylynge cornes & other vytayles / & his folke perisshed / & sawe also the moost party of his lond all wasted & voyde of people / he apparayled hy¯ & his folke y• were lefte alyue / & passed ouer in to lytel Brytayn with a lytel nauy vnto kyng Aleyn y• he moche loued that was his cosyn / & that his fader had moche loued in his tyme. And as they sayled in the see he made moche lamentacyon / & so dyd all those that were with hym / and sayd. Dedisti nos dite tan{quam} oues estarum et in gentibus dispersisti nos.  And than began Cadwaldre to complayne hym to his tolke pyteously / and sayd. Alas sayd he / to vs wretches and caytyues is sorowe for our grete synnes of the whiche we wolde not amende vs whyle we had space / & now repentaumce is comen vpon vs through mysaue¯ture whiche chaceth vs out of our owne realme & propre soyle / out of the whiche somtyme Romayns / Scottes / Saxons nor Danes myght not exple vs. But what auayleth it now to vs that before tyme dyuers tymes haue goten many other londes / syth it is not y• wyll of god that we abyde & dwell in our owne lode God that is very iudge that all thinges knoweth before they be done or made / he seeth that we wolde not cese of our synnes / & that our enemyes myght not vs nor our lygnage exyle fro and out of our realme / he wolde that we amended vs of our folyes / and that we sholde se our propre defautes / & therfore hath shewed to vs wrathe / & wyll chastyse vs of our misdedes / syth that he doth vs without batayle or strengthe of our enemyes by grete companyes wretchedly to leue our realme & propre londe. Turne agayn ye Romayns / turne agayne ye Scottes / turne agayne ye Saxons / turne agayn ye frensshmen / now sheweth to you Britayn all deserte / the whiche your power myght neuer make deserte / ne yet your power hath not put vs now in exde / but onely the power of the kyng almyghty whome we haue oft offended by our folyes / the whiche we wolde not leue vntyll he chastised vs by his diuyne power Amonge the wordes & lament acyons y• kyng Calwaldre made to his folke they arryued in lytel Gritayn & came to king Aleyn. And y• kyng receyued hym with grete ioye / & made him to be serued won ders nobly / and there he dwelled longe tyme after. The englysshe people that were lefte alyue & were escaped y• grete hunger & mortalite lyued in y• best wyfe that they might: & moche people sprang and came of them. And they sente in to saxonie where they were borne to theyr frendes for men / women / and chyldren to restore the citees with people and the townes that were all boyde of people / & for to labour / trauayle and tyll the e th. Whan the Saxons had herde these tydynges / they came in to this londe won ders thycke in grete companyes / & lodged themselfe in the coumtree all about where that they wolde / for they foumde no man to with stande them ne lette. And so they wexed & multyplyed gretly / & vsed the customes of y• coumtre wherof they were comen / and the lawes & the language of theyr owne londe. And they chaunged y• names of citees / townes / castelles / and boutghes / and gaue them names / and called them as they now be called. And they helde the coumtets / the batonages /    and the lordshyppes & countrees in maner as y• Brytons before ryme had compassed them. And amonge other grete companyes that came from Germayn in to this londe came y• noble quene that was called Sexburga with men & women without nombre / & arryued in the coumtree of Northumberlonde / & toke the lond from Albion vnto Cornewayle / for her & for her folke. For there was none that myght them let / for all was desolate & voyde of people / but it were a fewe poore Brytons that were lefte on mountaynes & wodes vutyll that tyme. And fro that tyme forth lost the Britons this realme for all theyr dayes / and the Englysshe people began to regne / & departed the londe bytwene them / and they made many kynges aboute by dyuers partes of the londe as here ben deuysed. The fyrst of Westsex / the seconde Merchenrych / the thyrde Estangle / the fourthe kent / & the fyfthe Southsex. All those regned in this londe after that Cadwaldre was passed out of this londe & dwelled in lytell Brytayn with kynge Aleyn his cosyn and true frende. And whan he had longe dwelled there / and had knowlege that the mortalite & pestylence was ouerpassed / & that the londe was replenysshed with alyen people / he thought to come agayn in to this londe / & prayed kynge Aleyn his cosyn of socour & helpe that he myght be restored agayn to his owne propre realme & fyrst dignite. And kynge Aleyn graumted hym his askyng. Than dyd he apparayle hym to take his waye & vyage in to this londe. And prayed god almyghty deuoutly that he wolde make to hym demonstracyon / yf his prayer in to this londe were to hym pleasaumt or not. For agaynst the wyll of god almyghty he wolde no thynge do. Whan he had thus deuoutly made his prayer / a voyce from heuen sayd to hym and badde hym leue that iourney away in to Englonde / and that he sholde go to the pope of Rome / for it was not y• wyll of almyghty god that y• Brycons sholde regne ony more in Brytayne / nor neuer recouer the lond vnto the tyme that the pphecy that Merlyn sayd before be fulfylled. And that shold neuer be vnto the tyme were comen that y• relykes of his body shall be brought fro Rome & translated in to Brytayne. And whan the relikes of other sayntes y• haue ben hydde for the persecucyon of the paynym folke shall be foumde and openly shewed / than shall they recouer theyr lo¯de agayn / the whiche they haue soo longe tyme loste through theyr deseruynge. Whan Cadwaldre had herde this answere / he mer uayled gretly / & tolde it to kyng Aleyn. Thankynge Aleyn sent for the clergye of his londe / and made them to brynge the storyes & prophecyes that Merliu & Sybyll had sayd in theyr prophecyes. And whan he knewe that the prophecy that Festom had prophecied of the Egle and other prophecyes accorded to the diuyne answere y• Cadwaldre had herdehe coumseyled hym & ryght faythfully desyred hym to leue his people & his nauy and submytte hym to the disposicyon of god / & do all that the aumgell had commaumded hym. Than Cadwaldre called ynor his sone and yuory his cosyn that was his systers sone / & sayd to them. Take sayd he my folke & my nauy that is here all redy / and passe in to wales / and be ye lordes of Brytons y• no dyshonour come to them by interrupeyon of y• paynyms folke for defaute of lordes. And than he hymselfe lefte his realme of Brytayne & his folke for euermore / & toke his waye vnto the pope of Rome Sergius / the whiche worshypped hym moche / and so he was confessed / & toke penaunce for his synnes. And he had not longe dwelled   there that he ne dyed the .xij. kalend of Maye / the yere of grace. b .C .lxxix.  How kynge Osfa was souerayne aboue all the kynges of Englonde / & how euery kyng warred vpon other. IT befell so that all the kynges in that tyme that were in the londe / as they of Westsex / Merchenrych / Estangle / of Kent / and of Southsex / and of other costes eche warred vpon other / & he y• was moost myghty toke the londe of hym y• was moost feblest. But there was a kynge amonge them that was called Offa / that was saynt Oswaldes broder. This Offa conquered all y• kynges of the lond / and regned aboue them all. And so grete was the warre in euery coumtre bytwene kynges that no man myght wyte how the londe went. But abbottes / pryours / and men of religyon wrote the lyues & dedes of kinges / how longe euery of them regned / & in what countree / & in what maner euery kyng dyed / and of bysshops also. And therof made grete bokes / and let call them cro nycles. And the good kynge Alured had that boke in his warde. And let brynge it vnto Wynchestre / and let it be fast tached to a pyller that men sholde it not remeue ne bere thens / so that euery man myght se it & thervpon loke. For therin ben conteyned the lyues of all y• kynges that euer were in Englonde.  How the kyng of Northumberlonde Osbryght forlaye the wyfe of Buerne Bocard through strength / & afterward this Buerne conquered the kynge with power and strengthe. ANd thus it befell in y• same tyme that there was a ky¯g in Northum berlonde that was called Osbryght / & soiourned at Yorke / & this kynge wente vpon a daye in to a wode for to dysporte hy¯. And whan he came agayn / he went pryuely in to a good mannes hous that was called Bucrne / & the good man of that place was gone that tyme to y• see. For oftentymes he went there to espye theues & robbers that oftentymes were wont to come in to the londe to robbe / brenne / & slee. The lady that was Buer nes wyfe was a wonders fayre woman And the kyng came vnto her whan her husbonde was absent. Ad so she trusted none harme vnto the kynge / and welcomed hym with moche honour / & worthely serued hym of all thynges. Whan the kynge had eten / he coke the lady by the hande and ladde her in to a chambre and sayd that he wolde speke with her in coumseyle. And made all y• folke vor de out of the chambre / saue onely the lady and he. But the lady wyst not wherfore he dyd it / tyll y• he had done all his wyll. And whan he had done this dede / he returned agayne to Yorke / & lefte the lady there sore wepyng for the dede that the kynge had done to her. And whan hee lord was comen home & sawe her wepe & make suche sorowe & mournynge / he asked of her what she had done / & why she made suche sorowe. Syr she sayd / subtylly and falsly the kynge Osbryght hath done me shame & vylany agaynst my wyll / & tolde hym the trouth how y• kynge had forlayne her with strength / wherfore she sayd she had leuer be deed than lyue. Fayre loue be styll sayd he / for agaynst strengthe feblenes is lytell worth / & therfore of me shalt thou neuer the lesse be loued / and namely for thou hast tolde me y• trouth. And yfalmyghty god graumte me my lyfe / I shall well auenge the. This Buerne was a grete man & a myghty lorde / & was well belo ued / & had grete frendes / & let sende for   the gretest lordes of the londe / & to them made his complaynt of ye despyte that ye kynge had done to hy¯ / & sayd y• he wolde be auenged how so euer it were. And all his frendes coumseyled hym yt he shold go to yorke where as the kyng was to defye hym. And Buerne  eke his meyny & came to the kyng. And whan the kyng sawe hym / he called hy¯ curteysly by his name. And Buerne answered hym / & to hym sayd. Syr I you defye / & yelde vp feautees / homages & londes / & as mothe as I haue holden of you / and from this tyme forwarde I wyll neuer of the no thynge holde. And so he departed fro the kynge without more speche or ony abydynge / and toke leue of his frendes and went in to Denmarke / & complayned to the kynge Godryne / & tolde hym of the despyte that kyng Osbryght had done to hym of his wyfe / & prayed hym of socour and helpe for to auenge hym. Whan kynge Godryne of Denmarke & the Danes had herde the complaynt of this Buerne / and of the prayer that he bad / they were wonders glad in theyr hertes / for as moche as they might fynde a cause for to go in to Englonde for to warre vpon Englysshmen / and also for to auenge Buerne of the despyte that yt kynge Osbryght had done to his wyfe. And for as moche as Buerne was sibbe vnto the kynge of Denmarke / they let ordeyne anone a grete hoost of men / and let ordeyne shyppes for them / & as moche as them neded to haue to that viage And whan all the hoost was redy / the kyng made his two bretherne chefe capytaynes / that were noble knyghtes of body and also bolde / that one was called Hungar / and that other Hubba.  How the Danes toke yorke / and slewe kyng Osbryght / and soone after slewe kynge Elle. ANd whan all thynge was redy the two brethern toke leue of the kynge Godryne / & went to warde the see for to passe ouer into Englo¯de as fast as they myght spede. Now is Buerne so well comforted / & so fast hyed hym with y• Danes / that they be arryued in y• north coumtree / & came through out Holdernes and destroyed all the coutre  / and brent townes / & robbed folke / & slewe all that myght be taken tyll that they came vnto yorke. And whan kynge Osbryght sawe them come / he toke all his people that he had with hym & came out of the cyte & faught wt them / but no foyson he ne had agaynst them / & moche of y• people there were slayne on bothe partyes / & kynge Osbryght hymselfe there was slayne / & the cite anone was taken & the Danes went in.  And there was also an other king in Northumberlond that Buernes frendes had chosen / and helde hym for kyng / a man y• was called Elle for as moche as they wolde not to kyng Osbryght be attendaumt / for the despyte that he had done to Buerne theyr cosyn. It bef  thus y• kyng Elle was gone to the wode for to dysporte  ym / & of venysou some he had taken. And as he sate in the wode at meet he sayd to a knyght. We haue well sped & moche venyson taken. And with y• worde came in a man & sayd to hym. yf ye so moche of venyson haue wonne / an hondred tymes more ye haue lost / for all this coumtree the Danes haue goten / & taken y• cite of yorke / & agaynst you shall it hold / y• neuer ye shall come therin / and for so moche they haue slayne kyng Os right. Whan king Elle herde these wordes / he let assemble all y• folke of the countree / & ordeyned all the power that he myght haue / and wolde haue goten the cite of yorke wt strength. But the Danes came out anone & gane hym a stronge batayle / and slewe kyng   Elle and the moost parte of the people that he had brought with him. And the same place there they were slayne shall euermore be called Elle crofte / and that place is a lytell from yorke. And than y• Danes neuer rested tyll they had conquered all Northumbetlonde / & in that countree they made wardryns / & went ferther in to y• lande & toke Notyngham & there they abode all y• wyuter / doynge all the sorowe that they myght. And after whan somet tyme came / they reineued from Notyngham / and came to Nicholl and Lyndefey / & to Holand. For no man myght them withstand / so moche power and sttength they had.  How saynt Edmund the kynge was martyred. ANd so ferre had the Danes passed from coumtree to coumtree / and euermore brennynge & robbynge / & destroyed all y• they myght tyll they came to Tetford / & in that coumtree they foumde a chrysten kyng that moche loued god & his werkes / that was called Edmund / & he was kyng of Northfolke & South folke. This kyng saynt Edmund ordeyned as moche folke as he myght / and fought wt the Danes / but he & his folke were discomfyted / & the kyng hymselfe was dryuen vnto the castell of Framelyngham / & the Danes pursued hym & tame vnto the same castell. And whan kyng Edmund sawe y• the castel myght not withstande them / he came agaynst them / with whome y• Danes fyrst spake / and anone they asked of hym where king Edmund was. Now forsothe said he / whan I was in y• castell there was the kyng / and whan I went out of the castell / he went out also / & whether he shall escape or dye / at goddes wyll must it be. Whan saynt Edmund had named god / by that they wyst well that it was hymselfe. And anone Hubba & Hungat toke hym and sayd that he shold forsake god and all chrysten lawes / as many other had done before hym. And saynt Edmund sayd that he wolde not / but ta ther he wold suffre deth for goddes loue & his lawes also. Than toke they kyng Edmund & boumde hym to a tree / & made theyr archers shote at hym wt arowes tyll y• his body stycked as full of arowes as an vrchen full of pryckes. But for all the payne that they dyd hym / he wolde neuer forsake god. And in the same turment and payne he dyed / and betoke his soule to almyghty god. And whan they sawe that he was deed / they smote of his heed. And in this maner as ye haue herde was saynt Edmund martyred.  How  Hubba and Hungar toke the towane of Redynge. WHan saynt Edmund was marry red / Hungar & Hubba departed thens with all theyr Danes to Redyng And as they wente thyder warde they destroyed & brent to w es and cyters & slewe all chrysten people that wolde not forsake god / and kest downe chirches & came to Redynge and toke the cownr & there helde them tyll that kyng Ed lf of Westsex came thider with at his power for to take y• to wne.

Ioha¯nes the seconde was pope after Bonifacius And this ma¯ had a grete stryfe wt Iustinian y• emperour / wheder y• Chryst was of two natures or one. The pope sayd he had two natures / one of god / an other of man. The emperour sayd / eyther consent to vs / or y• shalte go to perpetuall exyle. The pope answered. I desyred to come to Iustinyan the moost chrysten emperour / but as me semeth I haue founde Dioclesyan y• pursewer of chrysten men but certaynly I drede not thy malyce / ne I  ere not thy thretenynges. Than the empetour meked hy¯selfe & fell downe to the groumde / & asked mercy & absolucion.  Anno d i .v .C. xxxiiij. AGapitus a confess ur was pope after Iohn two yere. This Agapitus turned Iustinyan sully from the   errour of the Euticetes. This man ordeyned that processyons sholde be done on sondayes / & than he dyed at Constan tynople.  Siluerius a martyr was pope after this man thre yere. He was exiled fro chrysten fayth / & slayne by the proctour of Theodory / for he wolde not restore the bysshop of Athenes an heretyke to his benefyce agayn.  Virgili{us} was pope after hym .xvij. yere. And he entred yll in to his benefyce / but he gouerned hym well / & he suffred his perse cucyon pacyently / and he was exiled fro Rome. And at y• last after grete passions of Theodora in Constantynople dyed.  Sinodus quarta Consta¯tinopolitana contra Theodorum et oe¯s hereticos alios fuit isto te¯pore. Ista sinod{us} dampnauit heresim Theodori. qui dixit alium esse deum verum. et alium Christum. Et {quam} beata virgo non sit dei genitrix. sed hominis tantum.

Iustinus the seconde after Iustinian was Emperour .xj. yere. This man despysed poore men / he robbed the senatours / he was gyuen to all couetousnes / so that he made chestes of yren for to kepe his money in. Than anone he fell in to heresye / & wexed out of his mynde. And than was chosen Tyberius a good man for to gouerne the co myn people.  Tyberius y• second was emperour after Iustin{us} .vij. yere. This man was a vertuous man. He gaue innumerable good to poore men / in so moche that his wyfe often chydde wt hym / & sayd that he kest awaye the goodes of the empyre as stones. And he answered agayne & sayd. I trust in god that our chestes shall neuer lacke of money / & we put treasure in to heuen. And vpon a certayn daye whan he went by his palays at Constantynople / he sawe in the marble pauement a crosse grauen / & thought it sholde not be troden vpon / & comaunded to take it vp. For the crosse ought to be put in the hertes of faythfull men / & there he founde inestymable treasour of golde. This man subdued Harsas / and dyed blissedly.  Benedictus was pope after Iohn .iiij. yere. This man suffred grete persecucyon of hunger / pestylence and enemyes. This man brought many a thousande quarters of where from Egypte / whan Rome was besyeged by kyng Albanak / & almoost lost for vitayle wherfore they wrote on his graue this epytaphe. Magnatuis monumenta pater Benedicte reliqis: virtutum titulus et de us at{que} dolor.  Pelagius was pope after Benedictus .v. yere. In his tyme Rome was besyeged by y• loinbardes / & lytel he dyd in his dayes.  Mauricius was emperour after Tyberi{us} .xxj. yere. This was a very chrysten man / & subdued Persas & Armenias / & in y• latter ende of his dayes he dyscorded wt saynt Gregory / & entended to haue slayne hy¯. And than there appered a man in Rome clothed in a religyous habyte holdyng a naked swerde in his hande / & cryed about y• cite in this wyse. The emperour shall be destroyed / the whiche the emperour herde / & he correcked hy¯selfe of his trespace / & prayed to god to withdrawe his sentence from hym. To whome our lorde appered in his slepe & sayd. Wylte thou that I spare the now / or in tyme to come. And he was alouer of wretches & sayd. Gyue me here my reward. Than he was emperour after many a daye. And wham he shold haue correcked his knighttes for theyr extorcyon y• they dyd / they   asked hym why that he wolde not paye them theyr wages. And so they fell at varyaunce / & chose Foca for to be emperour / & slewe hy¯ & his .iij. sones.  This tyme saynt Austin came in to Englonde and ordeyned two archebysshops / that is to saye / of London / & of yorke / by the commaumdement of saynt Gregory. And remenbre y• many tymes is made mencyon of dyuers regyons & coumtrees / that often tymes they haue ben turned to y• fayth. For alwaye the fayth abode not in them for dyuers causes. So it is of Englonde Fraumce / Persia / Iewry / & in this thy¯ge Rome was preuileged / for there y• fayth of Peter neuer fayled.  Focas was emperour after Maurici his maister / whome he & other slewe / & bycause he began yll / he ended nought. For in his dayes y• Romayns fought strongly agaynst the Perses / & the Romayns were discomfy ted & lost many a prouynce / & at the last he was slayne of Heraclius. For as he dyd to other men / so was he done to.  Anno domini .v .C. lxxxiiij. GRegory the first a Romayn and a mo¯ke was pope after Pelagius xiij. yere. This man was called Gregorius magnus for many thy¯ges that he exceded in. he passed other men in power in ryches / in vertue / in noblenes / in wysdom / in holynes / in fame & in experience And vnder this man the yll thynges of cursednes passed & seced / & many a noble boke he wrote to y• incomparable {pro}fyte of all holy chirche. He was one of y• pryncypal doctours of all the .iiij. doctours of the chirche. This man forsothe alone wt sayiit Fabian after say¯t Peter was chosen of god in all the ordres of y• popes of Rome / many thynges he ordeyned in y• chirche / as is shewed in his regystre. Deus in abiutorium. for to be afore y• begynnynge of y• houres he commaunded to be sayd. He renewed & made all the offyces of the chirche in a fayrer & a more co¯ pendyous maner / the whiche abydeth yet vnto this daye / & it is called Gregorianum. And shortly to conclude on this holy man / mannes tongue can not expresse lyghtly the louynges of this ma¯ / what in wrytynges & also in examples of vertuous dedes.  Saumian{us} was pope after Gregory one yere & .v. monethes. This man ordeyned y• ringyng of belles at the houres of the daye. But this man backbyted saynt Gregory for his liberalite that he had to poore men / & thought he sawe say¯t Gregory rebuke hy¯ thryse for it / & the fourth tyme he lay in his bed & thought saynt Gregory smote him on the heed / and he waked & dyed anone. This was the thyrde pope amonge all y• popes y• whiche is noted to dye a dredefull deth.  Bonifacius y• thyrde was pope after Sauimanus .viij. monethes He ordeyned y• none but whyte clothes sholde be put on y• awter.  Bonifacius the fourth was pope .iiij. yere and .viij. monethes. This man purchased of the emperour Foca that the chirche of saynt Peter of Rome  shold  be y• heed of all the chirches in y• worlde. For afore Constantinople was y• heed chirche. Also he ga e lycence y• the chirche called Panton the whiche was dedycate to the honour of Neptunus & other fals goddes / where chrysten men many tymes were slayne of deuyls / myght be dedycate to y• worshyp of all sayntes in heuen. This man ordeyned y• monkes myght vse y• offyce of prechynge / chrystenynge & co¯fessyon.  Heraclius was emperour after Foca xiij. yere. And in the thyrde yere of his regne / Co ras y• kyng of Perses brent Ierusalem and other worshypfull places.  achary the patriarke with moche other people he toke & put in captyuice. The parte of the holy crosse the whiche   Cleyn lefte there he toke with hym in to his coumtre. But the .xij. yere of Herach{us} Cosoras was slayne of Heraclius / & the crosse was brought agayn / & the people were delyuered. And whan Heraclius  wold  haue entred y• cite proudly / the gates of y• cite by y• power of god shette by themselfe / & the emperour meked hy¯ to god aboue / & the gates opened. And than was the feest of y• exaltacyon of y• crosse made.  De{us} dedit was pope after Boniface thre yere. This was an holy man For on a certayn daye whan he kyssed a lepre / anone the lepre was hole.  This tyme a citezin of London through y• mocyon of Ethelbryght buylded a chirche of saynt Peter in the west parte of London / in a place y• was called Thorney.  Circa annum dn¯i. vj .C .xliiij. BOnifacius the fyfthe was pope after Deus dedit fyue yere / the whiche ordeyned that no man sholde be taken out of the chircheyerde. And lytel elles of hym is wryten.  Nota Machomitum. MAchomyte the duke of sarasyns and turkes was this tyme. And he was the deceyuer of all the worlde / a false prophete / the messenger of the deuyll / the foregoer of Antechryst / the fulfyller of heresy / and of all false men the meruaylest / of whome the dominacyon thus began.  There was a certayne famous clerke at Rome and coude not spede in his maters that he desyred to haue spedde in / than he receded from Rome ouer the see / and procured many a man to go with hym / amonge whome was this fals Machomyte a grete man of wytte. And this clerke {pro}mysed hym to make hym duke of his coumtree / yf he wolde be guyded after hym. There he nourysshed a doue / & put all y• corne that the doue ete in to Machomytes ere / & so this doue had neuer no meet but in his ere. The foresayd clerke on a daye called the people & meued them to chose suche a prynce as the holy ghost wolde shewe to them in fourme of a doue. And anone this clerke secretly let this doue flee / the whiche after his olde custome came to Machomyte / & put his byll in his eere. And whan the people sawe this / anone he was chosen duke of that people. And whan he was made duke of this people of Corosame / he sayd y• he was the very prophete of god. Than he made a boke of his lawe y• was called Alcaron. But he dyd it by the informacyon of thre of his maysters / to whom y• deuyll mynistred the auctorite & the connynge. The fyrst mayster was a iewe a grete astronomer & a nygromancer / the second was Iohn de Antiochia / the thyrde was Sergius an heretyke. And these thre made an vn gracyous lawe & an vnhappy / & what someuer was  hard  of byleue & tedyous to do / they lefte y• out of the lawe / & they put that thinge in theyr lawe y• worldly men were prone & redy to do / that is to saye / glotony / lechery / rapyne / & suche other. And also this Machomyte ordeyned y• a man shold haue as many wiues as he myght occupy & fynde / and refuse them twyse or thryse or .iiij. tymes / & take them again. And many meruaylous & fals thinges he made in his lawe / the whiche were to lo¯ge to reherse here / but they be playne in his boke of Alcaron / & euer he wrote i his boke y• our lord spake to Machomyte his {pro}phete / sayenge on this wyse or on this. Thus by his fals meanes he deceyued y• people. And wham his maysters & he had made this y• was so delectable / he wrote it in a boke with lettres of gold / & nourysshed a camell secretly in a pryuy place / & all onely wt the ha¯des of Machomyte was alway fedde   And there pryuely he tyed this boke of the lawe y• he had made about y• camels necke / & put this camell forth on a tyme in to a felde a fore daye / and this camell ioyed in his lyberte / for he was neuer lose afore. And he wold suffre no man to come & touche hym. And so there was a grete fame of suche a camell / and all the people ranne to se hym / amonge whom was this Machomyte. But whan the camell sawe hym that alway had fedde hym / anone he ranne vnto hym. And he had taught this camel afore tyme to fal downe on his knees & lycke his handes And so he dyd afore all the people. The people than cryed & sayd / that there was a very ensample that he was the true prophete of god. Than they prayed Machomyte to open y• holy boke wt his holy handes / the whiche was sent from heuen euermore to be kepte. In y• whiche boke is shewed how the people shall worshyp god. And Machomyte sayd. This boke was wryten with aumgels handes. So by these false meanes he turned to his lawe all the londe of Perse / & all the eest imperyall agaynst Heraclius the emperour. And he occupyed vnto the ende of Alexandre and Egypte / Libia / Arabia / & Siria. Than after he enfected all Affrica / & but that the grace of god wt stode hym he had enfected all spayne & fraumce And many other thynges he dyd / that were to moche to wryte in this boke. COnstantyne the thyrde / the sone of Heracli  was emperour .xxvij. yere. This Constantyne was a cursed man / a grete tyraunt / and an heretyke false / subtyll & obyous to chrysten men / nor he gaue no place to pope Martyn / & he reysed a grete host agaynst the Lombarbes / & there he lost the felde & fledde to Rome. And honourably was receyued of the pope Vitellian{us} / and other of the cite. And he rewarded them not lyke after theyr merytes as a prynce sholde haue done / but vsed forth tyranny & heresye / wherfore at y• last he was slayne of his owne knyghtes in a bath / y• whiche wolde no longer suffre his tyranny. And so he wretchedly lyued / & dyed vnhappely.  Martin{us} the first was pope after Theodorum .vj. yere. This Martinus was a very holy man / and strongly stroue for the fayth of god. And whan he sayd masse on a certayne daye at the awter / there pursued hym to slee hym a man whiche was called Spa arius of Olymphe / and whan he wolde haue  nytten hym he was blynde sodeynly. This same man called a Sinody in the cite of Rome / and he dampned Syrum / Alexandrum / Sergium / Pyrum / & Paulum heretykes. Wherfore Constantyne the emperour exiled hym / & he dyed a saynt  Eugenius a Romayn was pope after Martyn almoost thre yere / and was an holy ma¯ / but of hym lytell actes ben wryten.  Vitellianus was pope after hym .xiiij. yere. This ma¯ made y• songe that the Romayns vseth / and accorded it also with y• organes. And he also had the grace of the emperour / the whiche was wroth with his predecessours / neuerthelesse afterward he stode not in his co¯corde. Ne hytherto I coude not fynde that euer the chirche of Rome had fully after the deth of Constantyne y• myghty / the lordshyp of the cyte and of other the whiche he gaue to the chirche.  Anno dn¯i. vj .C. x iij. Adeodatus a Romain was pope after Vi s .iiij. yere / and in his dayes was translated the body of saynt Benedicti with the body of saynt Scolastice his syster fro y• hyll of cally  to the monastery of   nygh  relyan.  Constaneyneth fourth was   emperour after his fader Constantyne the cursed man. This Constantyne was a good man / & he hated heretikes aboue all thynge / the chirche he repayred / and grace he reconsyled agayne to ye chirche of Rome / & he with ye pope gadred togyder the syxth generall sinody / in y• whiche was graumted to preestes of Grece to vse theyr lefull wyues / & to the preestes of the eest / for cause of grete heet / but not to those of the west party by no meanes for they amytted chastite in the tyme of saynt Gregory. And euery man may aduertyse & pondre how moche ye goodnes of a prynce is worth to the quyete state of the chirche / & to the promocyon of the fayth. And also the contrary / how moche the malyce of a prynce hurteth / ye thy¯ge these two Constantynes the fader & the sone shewed openly. For in the faders days the chirche neuer had rest / & in the sones tyme it was quyete. Yet neuerthelesse our lorde suffred the sarasyns & the vulgars to entre in this emperours londe / yt he myght not withstande them but that he made his peas with them / and payed yerely to them a truage / so myghtely preuayled that cursed secte of Machomyte / & after he dyed blyssedly.  Nota. that there were syxe generall synodyes & moost pryncypall / of ye whiche the auctorite is equall to the gospell for the treuth of the gospell is declared by them / agaynst ye syxe pryncypall heresyes / the whiche strongly troubled ye chirche / for the subtylte of those heretykes to deceyue symple men.  Aboute this tyme dyed saynt Cedde of Lychfel  the thyrde yere of his bysshopryche.  Demus a Romayn was pope after Adeodatus thre yere / of this man lytell is wryten.  Bonifacius was pope after hym / & lytell of hym is wryten / but  hat he lyued lyke a preest.  Agatho  as pope after hym / & he was a very holy man. For on a day whan he kyssed a lepre / the lepre a none was made hole. Iste et de consensu principis iussit celebrari sexta¯ synodum apud Constantinopolin CC .lxxx.  pmorum / in qua assere  duas naturas et duas volumtates esse in Christo.  Leo the seconde was pope after Agatho .iij. yere. This Leo was an holy ma¯ & suffycyently taught in latyn & greke. This man ordeyned that the pax  shold  be gyuen after Agnus dei / and dyed a blyssed man.  Benedictus the seconde was pope after Leo almoost thre yere. This man about all thynges was vertuous: & his name accorded wt his dedes And in his tyme was a grete pestyle¯ce.  Iustinianus the seconde was emperour this tyme / & he was a very good man / a prudent & a large / & he encreased the empyre of Rome myghtely / but he charged y• offyce of ye chirche ouermoche Many lawes he made / & afterwarde he wexed not good / for he entended to haue letted ye decrees of ye vj. sinody / wherfore the .x. yere of his empyre he was taken of Leo the prynce of Patricio & Tyberio / & they cut of his nose & his tongue & exiled hy¯ to Crisona¯. Than was a grete turbacyon in ye chirche for stryfe & heretykes. And knowe all men wham variaumce falleth bytwene grete lordes / than errours ben multiplied: for there is no ma¯ correcketh them / therfore yt is oft tyme preued in ye chirche. Than after fell a varyaumce bytwene Leo & Tiberio / & Tiberio preuayled / & he exiled Leo / & cut of his nose the thyrde yere of his regne: & regned for hy¯ Iustinyan fled to ye sarasyns & the bulgars / y• whiche restored hym agayne to his empyre / & slewe Leo & Tyberio / the whiche fauoured heretikes. Than this same Iustinyan reformed hymselfe to ye chirche of god / & had grete repentaumce / but he venged hym to cruelly on his aduersaryes / so that he wolde haue slayne   theyr Innocent chyldren. Therfore he was slayne with his sone / of Phylyp whome he exiled.  Anno dn¯i. vj .C .lxxxiiij. IOha¯nes the fyfth was pope after Benedictus one yere. He was a good man / but he decessed anone.  zeno was pope after hym / & he was a very holy man / for he wold not meddle with seculer maters / & in beaute he was as an aumgell / quyete in vertues / & meke in soule / & very demure in language of his religyous lyfe. This man was chosen at the last with one accorde of ye chirche and lay men / but there was a grete distinccyon / for ye clergy entended to haue chosen Pyers the archebisshop / and the hoost of lay men wolde haue had Theodorum a preest. But at ye last ye holy ghoost turned the wyll of all this people vnto this holy man.  Sergi{us} was pope .ix. yere. This ma¯ was vertuous & commendable in his lyfe / & in his eleccyon was a grete discord / for one party of ye clergy chose Theodo{rum} / & an other party Pascalem. But as our lorde wolde at the last they turned all to this man. This man translated the body of saint Leo. He also foumde a grete parte of the holy crosse by myracle. And he baptysed Cadwalidus the last kynge of Brytayn. He commaunded Agnus dei to be sayd or songe thryse at masse / & decessed blyssedly.  Nota.  Saynt Bede the worshypfull preest was this tyme a man of grete fame in Englonde / y• whiche was taken the .vij. yere of his age to Benedict the abbot of Gyrwyensis monastery to be taught / & than after to Colfrido the abbot after ye deth of Benedict. And at .xix. yere of his age he was made deken of the bysshop of Yorke. And at .xxx. yere he was made preest / in the whiche yere he began to wryte. So he contynued all the tyme of his lyfe in that monastery / in gyuynge his labours to wrytyng / & for scripture to be expowned he made .lxxviij. bokes the whiche he nombreth in y• ende of his englysshe boke. This man was euer in labour / eyther in prayer or in syngynge dayly in ye chirche / or to lerne / or to  che or to wryte. For the whiche thynge men may iudge by reason that he was neuer at Rome / all though some saye he went to Rome / yt he myght se yt his bokes accorded wt the doctryne of ye chirche. But it was certayne that he was blynde / & went to preche / & had a seruaumt yt was not good / & made hy¯ to preche to a grete multytude of stones / and sayd that they were men / & whan all his sermon was done / the stones answered & sayd amen. But yt he went to Rome thryse / & foumde wryten thre arres & thre effes & expowned them / it was neuer foumde in no boke of auctorite. There was after ye talking of the people suche a wrytyng on the gates of Rome RRR. FFF. And suche an exposicyon. Regna Rome Ru . Ferro Fla¯ma et Fame. But it is certayne that Bede was desyred to come to Rome by the wrytynge of Sergius the pope vnto Colfrido his abbot. And this Bede translated the gospell of saynt Iohn in to Englysshe tongue / & decessed blyssedly. The fame sayth y• now he lyeth at Deuelyn with saynt Cuthberto / & there is buryed with hym the knowlege of the dedes of Englonde almoost to ye conquest.  Leo the seconde was emperour and lytell of hym is wryten.  Liberi{us} was emperour after hym. vi . yere / the whiche arose agaynst Leo & entred his kingdom / & kepte hym in prison as longe as he regned. In his tyme Iustinyan the seconde y• whiche in olde tyme was exiled to Crisona¯ / openly sayd he wolde recouer his empyre agayn. Wherfore the people of that coumtree for ye loue of Liberius   were about to slee that Iustinyan / wherfore he fledde to the prynce of Turco{rum} / & wedded his syster / & through the helpe of his broder & the Bulgars he recouered his empyre / & slewe Liberius & Leo the vsurper of his realme. And as many tymes almoost as he wyped ony drop from his nose the whiche they kyt of / so many tymes he made one of his enemyes to be slayne.  Leo the thyrde was pope after Sergi{us} two yere. This man was made pope by the power of ye Romayns / & was not put in ye nombre of popes / for he yll entred / but he dyd none yll.  Ioha¯nes the syxth a Greke was pope after hym. And he was a martyr / but of whome & wherfore y• cause is not foumde in hystoryes. It is sayd y• it was of ye dukes of Lombardy / for they were enemyes to ye chirche myghtely.  Ioha¯nes the .vij. a Romayn was pope after hym thre yere / but no thinge of hym is wryten.  Iustinianus the seconde was emperour agayne wt his sone Tiberius .vj. yere. And this was he whiche was reued of ye empyre afore by Leo And wham this man was restored agayn he toke hym to the ryght fayth / & worshypped the pope Constantyn / & certaynly he destroyed Creson the place where he was exiled to / & all that dwelled in it (excepte children) he slewe them. And he came agayn an other tyme to haue slayne the Innocentes / & the men of coumtree made them a capytayn a certayne man that was called Philip an outlawe / the whiche anone wente to hym in batayle and slewe hym for his cruelnes agaynst those children.  Sysinnius was pope xx. dayes / & than was grete stryfe / and he decessed / but lytell of hym is wryten.  Constantyn was pope after hym. vij yere. This man was a very meke man & so blyssed / that of all men he was beloued. He went ouer the see to Iustinyan the emperour / & was receyued wt grete honour / & dyed a blyssed man.  Philip the seconde was emperour one yere / the whiche fled in to Scisilia for ye hoost of ye Romayns. And he was an heretyke / & commaumded all pictures of sayntes to be destroyed. Wherfore the Romayns kest away his coyne / nor wolde not receyue no money y• had his ymage or his name wryten vpon it.  Anastasius ye second after he had slayne Philyp was emperour thre yere. This man was a christen man / & lyued well. But bycause he put out Philips eyen & slewe hy¯ afterward / therfore Theodosius fought against hy¯ and ouercame hym / and than he was made a preest / & so lyued quyetly.  Anno domini. vij .C .xiiij. O Regorius ye seconde was pope after Constantyn .xvij. yere. This Gregory was a chaste man / and a noble man in scripture. And about this tyme the popes began to dele more temporally with ye emperours than they were wont for theyr falsnes & theyr heresy / and also for to remeue the empyre fro one place to an other as the tyme requyred. This man cursed Leo the emperour bycause he brent the ymages of sayntes. This same Leo commaumded Gregory the pope that he shold brenne chirches & destroye them. And the pope set no thynge of his sayenge / but manly commaunded the contrary. And so it is openly shewed / that ye destruccion of the empyre of Rome was the cause of heresy. For certaynly faythfull people with theyr prelates with one wyll drewe vnto the pope / and constrayned the emperours for to leue theyr tyranny and theyr heresyes.  And this tyme in the eest partyes of the worlde strongly fayled the very true fayth / for that cursed lawe of false Machomyte.  Theodost{us} was emperour / & regned   but one yere / & he was a very chrysten man / & euen as he dyd / so was he done vnto. For Leo deposed hym & made him a preest.  Leo the thyrde wt Constantyn his sone was emperour .xxv. yere. This Leo whan he was myghty he deposed Theodosius / & regned for hym / & was deceyued by a certayn apostata / y• whiche bad hym that he shold take & brenne all the ymages of sayntes / wherfore he was punysshed bothe in batayle and in pestyle¯ce / & with other infortunes. And bycause he was accursed of Gregory / & abode therin thre days / therfore ye pope with the comyn people toke from hym all ye west parte of his empyre / commaundynge that no man sholde obey hym / ne socour hym / bycause he lyued lyke an heretyke. Holy men sayd agaynst hym / and many by hym were martyred & exiled. And at the last in his mysbyleue he dyed wretchedly. And in this mannes dayes but that Karol{us} Marcellus holpe the chrysten fayth and fought manly agaynst the sarasyns / & droue them backward in to Spayne y• whiche they had subdued / els they had entred in to fraumce And Karolus slewe thre hondred thousande sarasyns & more / & of his people were slayne but .xv. thousand.  Nota This man for ye contynual batayle toke to lay men the treasour of the chirche / wherfore saynt Euchery the bysshop of Aurilian as he was in his prayers saw that same Karolus in soule & body payned in hell. And the aumgell that shewed the bysshop this man / sayd that y• was the iudgement of all those yt toke awaye the goodes of ye chirche / or of poore men. And to fortyfye that ye the bysshop sayd & to proue it / the abbot of saynt Denys went to the sepulture where that Karolus was buryed / & opened the chest that he lay in / and there they sawe a dragon go out / but he had no body.  Gregory the thyrde a Romayne was pope after Gregory the seconde / the whiche confermed the worshyppynge of the ymages of sayntes / with the coumseyle almoost of a thousande bysshops. And he horrybly cursed al the despysers of these ymages as the emperour and other that were of that condicion.  Constantinus y• fyfth was emperour after his fader Leo. xxxv yere. He was a cursed man and a pure heretyke / so that he dyd sacrifyce to deuyls / he pursued the chirche / & noth ge that is good of hym is wryten. And so by the suffraumce of god the chirche was troubled lo¯ge tyme.  About this tyme were many meruayles / and there were meruaylous erth quakes. And certayn cytees that were set vpon mountaynes / they were remeued & borne away with the hylles into the feldes. v . mile thens as they stode / and the cytees were not broken nor hurte. In the londe of Mesopotanyan the erthe was broken by the space of two myle. And also there was a mule whiche spake in a mannes voyce. Asshes fell from heuen. And in the see of Pontico there was yse for grete frost y• was .xxx. cubytes of thycknes. And sterres fell from heuen so myghtely that men trowed that the ende of the worlde had ben comen. All these betokened meruaylous thynges to come.  Anno domini. vij .C .xliiij. AFter Gregori zacharias was pope .x. yere. This zachary was a noble man / & arayed with all vertues / with all men he was loued for his mekenes. And he deposed the kyng of Fraumce Hydery / & put in his place Pippinum / for he was more profytable. Here ye may se what power y• chirche had that tyme the whiche translated that famous kyngdom from the very heyres to the kyngdom of Pippyn / for a lefull cause. Vt habetur.   xv. q .v. alius.  Stephanus the second a Romayn was pope after zacha ry .v. yere. This man in all thynge was profytable vnto the chirche / as well in worde as in doctryne. And he gouerned the spirytualte & the temporalte nobly. He was the louer & the defender of poore men. This man anoynted Pippinum the kyng of Fraumce / & sent hym agaynst the Lombardes / that he sholde co¯pell them to restore the chirche of suche goodes as they had withholden from them longe tyme vnryghtwysly / the whiche he dyd He also translated the empyre of the Grekes to the frenssh men.  Paulus a Romayn was pope after hy¯ .x. yere. This was a very holy man / for he dyd grete almes to faderles children & prysoners / wydowes and other poore men / that he myght be a folower of saynt Paule.  Constantyn y• second a Romayn was pope after Paule two yere. This Constantyn was a lay man / & sodeynly was made a preest as a tyraumt / & toke on him the dignite of the pope / and with a grete sclaumdre to the chirche was pope a lytell tyme. But the faythfull men put hym out / & put out his eyen. And this was y• fyfthe infamed pope amonge so many hytherto / so the holy ghoost that holy apostles seet kepte in all honour and holy nes.  Infynyte martyrs were made this tyme by Constantyn the emperour for he was suche an heretyke. And men trowe that there was neuer emperour nor no paynym that sleme so many martyrs. And this tyme y• chirche was troubled full sore / & very precyously bought the worshyppyng of y• ymages of sayntes / for y• grete shedynge of blode of martyrs. And certaynly that cursed emperour was not vnpunysshed. For whan he dyed he cryed with an horryble voyce & sayd. I am taken to a fyre that is vnable to be destroyed / and so he yelded vp the ghost to euerlastyng payne.  The empyre of Rome was deuyded aboute this tyme. For Stephen y• pope translated ytaly & other to Karolus yet a yonge man. And Constantyn helde the londe of Grece with other londes ouer y• see with a grete labour / and many rebellynge.  This tyme Karolus magnus was a noble yonge man / & he began for to regne vpon Fraumce / & was the sone of Pippinus / and his moder was called Berta.  Stephanus the thyrde was pope after Paulus thre yere / & he amended all the errours of Constantyne. And he degraded all those the whiche Constantyn ordeyned in a gouernall synody.  Anno domini. vij .C .lxxxiiij. ADrianus a Romayn was pope after Steuen .xxiiij. yere. This man was myghtely worshypped of the people / no man greter afore hym in honour / rychesse & buyldynge. This man set two solempne synodyes. The fyrst of iij .C. and l. faders. The seconde in Rome with an hondred & fyfty faders / beynge present Charles the kynge of Fraunce / to whome it was graunted the lyberte of eleccyon of the pope / and to ordeyne y• apostles seet.  Leo the fourth regned emperour with y• Grekes .v. yere. This Leo was a cursed ma¯ / but not so moche as his fader was / & he was a couetous man / & he toke away a certayne crowne of a chirche / and put it vpon his heed / & anone he was corrupted with an axes & so decessed. And he had a cursed wyfe the whiche regned after hym with her sone.  Constantyn was emperour after Leo / & he was a meke man / and put awaye his moder fro y• kyngdom / that she myght take hede vnto her womens werke. But she with a fayned rancour put out his eyen afterwarde / & his children   also / and regned agayne thre yere. And at the last she was aboute to haue ben wedded. And whan the Grekes perceyued that she wold be wedded to grete Karol{us} / they toke her & shette her vp in a monastery / & toke Nichoferum to be theyr emperour.  The .v. vniuersall study y• whiche in olde tyme was translated from Athenes to Rome about this tyme was translated to Parys by Karolus kynge of Fraumce.  Nichofer{us} was emperour after Constantyn. He was a very nygon / & was exalted to his empyre by the Grekes / but he profyted not / for in his tyme all the eest Imperyall was brought to nought. For the Romayns put them vnder Karolus magn{us}.  Ierusale¯ about this tyme was recouered by Karolus / with all the holy londe. And the secte of sarasyns was destroyed strongly. For the destruccyon of wretches came than.  Mychaell was emperour two yere. And he was a very chryst  man / & was wel beloued / & was also conuynge in all scyences. And those that Nichofer{us} had hurte & distressed of theyr goodes by his couetousnes / this Michaell restored the¯ theyr goodes agayn.  Nota. Karolus magnus the fyrst saynt was emperour after Michaell / & he was crowned emperour by Leo the pope. From y• whiche tyme the empyre was translated fro the Grekes to Fraumce & Germany. And for the translacyon of y• empyre / the Grekes alway were defectyue vnto y• Romayns & the Grekes stroue euermore wt them / but it was more wt venymous wordes than wt strength / & more wt craft than wt batayle. For they had so grete enuy at y• Romayns that they wolde not obey the chirche of Rome. For certaynly whan y• the popes  wold  wryte vnto them for to obey the chirche of Rome / they wrote agayn and sayd. Ye haue taken from our kynrede the empyre / & therfore we wyll you not obey / and we vs take from you And as touchynge this noble emperour Karolus / it is to be vnderstande / this man wham he was a yonge man he was anoynted kynge in Fraumce by Stephen the pope / in the yere of our lorde Iesu Chryst. vij .C. and .liiij. whan his tader Pippinus lyued / vnder whom / & with whome he regned .xv. yere / to the deth of his fader. Than after the deth of his fader in the yere of our lorde god. vij .C .lxviij. this Karolus with his broder Karolo manna regned two yere. Than his broder decessed in the seconde yere. And this Karolus than helde all y• hole k ng dome .xiiij. yere / to the yere of our lorde vij. hondred .lxxxiiii. in the whiche yere he wente vnto Rome that he myght be crowned emperour of the pope Adryan. And there he regned emperour. rvi. yere / to the yere of our lorde god .viii .C. whan pope Leo confermed hym agayn to be emperour. And after that he was emperour .xiiij. yere. And this Karolus magnus decessed in the yere of his age lxxij. the whiche was the yere of our lorde god .viij. hondred and. riiii.  Yf   wyll se more of this Karolus go to the boke of the bysshop Turpinus and  braminus his mayster / for they wrote his noble actes euerychone.   o the fourth was pope after Adrian.  . yere. This man whan he went on a cet ayn daye with the Letany to saynt Peters chirche on saynt Markes daye / he was taken with cursed people / the whiche put out bothe his eyen / and his tongue was cutte of. But our lord meruaylously restored hym agayne his syght & his speche / so that he spake without tongue and sawe by myracle. And afterwarde he went to Karolus in to Fraunce. And he came with hym to Rome / and there venged the pope of his enemyes. And than he crowned Karolus / and he late   afore crowned / confermed hym agayne.  Ludouicus y• meke / the fyrst begoten sone of Karol{us} was emperour after his fader .xxvi. yere / in whose time was put away that clerkes sholde vse no gyrdels with precyous stones / ne straumge arayment. This Ludouic{us} on his fyrst wyfe gate two children / & bothe had an yll ende In all thynge y• went agaynst hym he was pacyent / & in the last ende euer he ouercame it / for towarde god he abode deuoute / & his chyldren folowed his condicyons / and he decessed a blyssed man.  Stephanus the fourth was pope after Leo .iij. yere. This Stephanus redemed many captyue men / & crowned Lodewyke the emperour / & than he decessed / & was buryed at Rome.  Paschall was pope after Stephan{us}. This Paschall gaue grete dilyge¯ce to relykes of sayntes / & he toke vp innumerable bodyes of sayntes / & buryed them worshipfully / as in the visyon of saynt Cecile he was commaumded.  Eugenius y• fourth was pope after Paschall / and he was a very holy man / and those thynges that were for Chryst he toke hede to. This man was crowned a martyr / & by y• lay men of Rome he was buryed in saynt Peters chirche yerde.  Circa annum dumi. viij .C .xliiij. TAlentinus was pope after Eugeny .xl. days / & lytell of hym is wryten.  Gregory y• fourth was pope after him .xij. yere. This Gregory sawe many heuy tymes for y• plages among the comyn people. And at this mannes peticion Lodewyke y• emperour / & Marchio the prynce of Lombardy exyled all sarasyns from ytaly / & at the last he decessed after innumerable good dedes & werkes y• he had done at saynt Peters.  Lotherius the first sone of Lodewyke was emperour .xv. yere in Ytaly and in Rome & in the partes of Germayn nexte to the hylles of Alpy. This Lothertus rose agaynst his broder Lodewike & Karolus for the kyngdom of Duchelonde / the whiche somtyme Pippin{us} theyr broder helde / & they fought at a place called Fontanetum / where Lothery was disco¯fyted / & there was suche slaughter made on bothe sydes / that they had no men to resist theyr aduersaryes. This vnderstode a fals chrysten man / & sent vnto y• Sowdan of the sarasyns that he sholde come anone. And he toke Rome / & saynt Peters chirche was made a stable for theyr horses. But Lodewyke with the frenshmen and lombardes all that infynyte multytude destroyed / & that with grete shedynge of chryste¯ blode.  Sergius y• second was pope after Gregory two yere. This ma¯ was fyrst called Os porci / in englisshe hogges mouth / wherfore that man & after all y• popes names are chaumged whan they be chosen. And that for thre causes. The first for Chryst chaumged y• names of those men whiche he made popes. The second for as moche as they are chaumged in name / so sholde they be chaumged in pfeccyon of lyfe. The thyrde leest he whiche is chosen to an excedynge degree  shold  be hurte in name.  Leo was pope after Sergius .viij. yere. This Leo was an holy ma¯ / & also he was in prudence as sharpe as a serpent / & in his dedes as meke as a doue. And he was brought forth vertuously in a monastery. And whan that he was made pope / he laboured to repayre his chirches agayn / the whiche the fals sarasyns one after an other had destroyed This man was a myghty wryter and a grete precher / & a myghty labourer in watche & prayer / and so dyed / and was buryed & lyeth at saint Peters.  Bene dictus a Romayn was pope after Leo two yere. This Benedictus had the name   of the thynge / for in all thynge was he blyssed. And he ordeyned that clerkes shold go ordynatly & honestly.  Ludouicus y• sone of Lothery was emperour this tyme / & anoynted of Sergio y• pope & a whyle regned wt his fader / & after he regned .xxi. yere alone. This man had a sone y• hight Karol{us} / in to whom a deuil entred / & vexed hy¯ afore his fader / & than he conspyred his faders deth / & in his tyme fell many meruayles.  Nota. Ioha¯nes Anglic{us} of y• nacyon of Maguntyn about this tyme was pope / & she was a woman arayed in ma¯nes garmentes. But she {pro}fyted moche in holy scripture. Than she was chosen pope / but she was afterwarde wt childe / & goynge openly in {pro}cession she trauailed & decessed. And this is y• .vj. pope yt to this tyme had y• name of holynes / & were vicious / & this {per}son as other cursed popes were was punisshed of god / nor she was not nonbred in y• boke of popes.  Nicola{us} a Romayn was pope after this woman .ix. yere. This man exceded all other in holynes / saue saynt Gregory / & after decessed / & lyeth in say¯t peters chirch yerd.  Adrian a Romayn was pope after Nicolas. This man cursed Lothery y• emperours broder king of Lothering for his aduoutry. But whan he came wt his noble men to Rome to excuse hy¯ for his auoutry / he sayd he was cursed wrongfully / & all dyed in one yere & y• king dyed goyng to y• cite of Place¯cia¯  This tyme came the Danes in to Englonde.  Alured.  Anno dn¯i. viij .C .lxxiij.  Of kynge Alured / & how the Danes in his tyme prayed hym of mercy / that they myght go out of the londe. AFter y• deth of Eldred regned his broder Alured y• Dolfynes was called. Than went y• Danes & assembled them / & went forth to seke Alured y• tho was newly made kyng of Southsex / & there they foumde hym at Wylton wt a lytell power / & neuerthelesse he fought wt them / but at y• last he fledde thens from the felde & went in to westser & ordeined of his owne realme & of other y• he had a strong power / so y• the Danes coude not withstande hy¯. And he came to London wt his hoost where y• Danes soiourned / & wolde haue fought wt them. But the Danes durst not / but prayed hy¯ of peas & that they myght go agayn in to theyr owne coumtree / & neuer more to come in to englo¯d agayn ony harme to do / gyuyng hym hostages suche as he wolde aske.  How Hubba & Hungar were slayne at Chyppenham / and how the Danes brought theyr kynge vnto our kynge. ANd the same daye y• the Danes departed fro London they rode so fast bothe nyght & day / & neuer rested tyl that they came vnto Excestre / & toke the towne / & there helde them.  Whan kynge Alured herde these tydynges anone he let take the hostages / and went from thens vnto Excestre wt all y• power that he had. And whan y• Danes herde tell of his comyng / they went from thens vnto Westsex / & came to Chippenham / and there they dyd moche harme in the countree / they robbed folke / and brught them in to pryson. The kynge Alured pursued them & came vpon them with all his people and fyersly them assayled   And there were slayne bothe Hubba and Hungar his broder / & Buerne Bocard. And in this batayle was moche people slayne on that one parte & on that other. But the gree of that felde abode with y• Danes / for as moche as the kyng came with lytell company. The kyng hasted hy¯ as moche as he myght to go agayn. And whan y• Danes foumde Hubbaes body lyenge deed / they buryed it / & made vpon it a grete lodge / & let call it Hubbe  lowe / & so it is called vnto this daye / & yt place is in Deuenshyre. The barons of Somerset / Wyltshyre / & Dorset herde tell how theyr king was discomfyted / & ordeyned all y• power that they myght / & came to the kyng where as he was / & thanked god that they foumde hym alyue for they had wende y• Danes had slayne hym. Than the kyng & his barons concluded to go seke the Danes & to fyght with them. And so they rode all y• nyght and on the morowe aboute pryme came to Abyngdon where as y• Danes were. Thankkyng Alured & his barons assem bled them / & egerly assayled the Danes & there gaue them a stronge batayle / & the Danes long tyme put them of / that no man wyst whether parte lost moost folke. But thus it befell as god wolde yt the kyng Alured had the victory wt moche honour. For the Danes were so dryuen / that they ne wyst whether to turne And .xv. dayes the kyng them pursued at his wyll / that glad & fayne they were for to speke of peas / & toke to hym good hostage / & sayd they  wold  neuer warre more vpon hy¯. And more ouer they promysed kyng Alured that they wolde go & brynge theyr owne kyng vnto hym / & that theyr kyng & they all shold be baptised. And vpom this co¯dicyon king Alured graunted them lyfe & lymme / & sayd to them that they shold go seke theyr king and at a certayne daye that was set to come agayne to hym. And so they went forth fast / & came agayne at theyr daye that was assigned / & y• Danes brought theyr kynge with them. Kynge Alured anone let them be baptysed / & theyr names were chaunged / so that the kynge of Denmarke was called Athelstone / & xxx. of his felawes names were chaunged also / & the other were baptysed to y• ryght byleue. And all this was done at Westmynster / & after that kyng Alured helde with hym kyng Athelston and all his Danes .xij. dayes at soiourne with grete solempnite / and gaue them grete gyftes. After that they toke theyr leue & departed. Than was king Alured well at ease whan he had ouercomen his enemyes / and that they were turned to the ryght byleue of almyghty god.  How y• Danes y• went in to Fraumce wt Gurmond / came agayn in to Englonde. And of the deth of kynge Alured.   ANd thus it befel afterward that the Danes of Northumberlond   that were paynyms came with a grete strength & an huge hoost of fraumce / that is to be vnderstande / with them y• went into Fraumce with Gurmond of Affryke whan he had conquered Englond & gaue it to the saxons. And those that came fro fraumce arryued in Kent / & sent in to Northumberlonde that they sholde come to them. And whan those two hostes were comen & assembled / anone they went to destroye all y• chrysten people of englond from place to place / & dyd moche sorowe  In this tyme dyed kyng Alured that was wont to abbate the Danes / & .xxx. yere he regned / & had ben a good king / & well coude chastyse his enemyes / & also he was a good clerke / & let make many bokes / & a boke he made in englysshe of auentures of kynges & of batayles that had ben done in y• loud / & many other bokes he let wryte of grete wisdom & good lernynge / on whose soule god haue mercy / & lyeth at Wynchestre. IOha¯nes the .viij. was pope after Adryan .viii. yere. This Iohn anoynted Karolus y• emperour / & he suffred grete wronge of y• Romayns / for he fauoured not the sayd emperour / & therfore he put y• sayd pope in kepynge. Also he degraded y• bisshop of Portuense that was y• cause of al his sorowe.  Karolus y• second was emperour after Ludouic{us} This Karol{us} had a broder y• was called Lodwyke / & he was kyng of Germayn & he ordeyned a batayle agaynst his broder / but Karol{us} or they fought was poysoned / and he made many a monastery.  Martinus was pope after Iohn one yere. This Martyn lytell {pro}fyted / for he lyued but lytel tyme.  Adrian{us} y• thyrd was pope after hy¯ one yere / & of hy¯ is nothy¯ge wryten.  Stephan{us} the .v. was pope after hy¯ .vi. yere / & no thinge of hy¯ is wryten / but y• he translated y• body of saynt Martyn.  Karolus y• thyrd was emperour after y• second .xij. yere. This Karolus peasybly had in possessyon all fraumce & Germayn / & was crowned emperour of Iohn y• pope. And after his gloryous victory he turned all Normandy to y• fayth. And he myght no more resyst the frensshmen but .iiij. yere he regned on them / & he was vnprofytable to them / & therfore they put hym away.  Arnulphus was emperour after Karolus.  ij yere.

He enduced the noble men to swere that after the dethe of Agapitus they sholde those Octauianum his sone pope. And so it was done / & was named Iohn / & he was a hunter and a lecherous man / so that openly he kepte women. Wherfore certayn cardynalles wrote to Ottonem the emperour of Almayn / that he sholde come to Rome for to helpe to destroye the sclaundre of the chirche. This the pope perceyued / & the hande that wrote that pystle he made to be cutte of. And many tymes he was warned by ye Emperour & the clergy that he sholde correcte hym selfe.

Of kynge Edgar that regned aboue the kynges of Scotlonde and of Wales And how he was begyled through the takynge of his wyfe. ANd after this Edwyne regned Edgar his broder / a man that moche loued god & peas / & holy chirche also / and was a worthy man & a grete lorde of blode & myghty / & maynteyned well this lo¯de in peas. And this Edgar was lorde & kyng aboue all the kynges of Scotlond & of Wales / from the tyme that Arthur was gone was neuer syth kynge of his power. And this Edgar was saynt Edwardes fader. And wham Edgars wyfe was deed that was sayt Edwardes moder and buryed / he herde speke of the fayrnes of Estrylde / yt was Orgarus doughter a baron of Deuenshyre that was so fayre a woman / that all men spake of her. He called one of his knyghtes that he moche loued & trusted vpon / & sayd to hym. Go sayd he to the noble baron Orgar{us} of Deuenshyre & se yf that his doughter be so fayre as men speke of / & yf it be soth I wyll haue her to my wyfe. This knyght that was called Edelwolde went forth his waye as the kynge hym had sayd / & came where as the lady was. And wham he sawe her so fayre / he thought to haue her hy¯selfe to his wyfe / & therof spake to Orgarus her fader / & her fader was an olde man and had no moo chyldren but her onely / and sawe that Edelwolde was a fayre yonge knyght and worthy & ryche / and was well beloued with the kynge / and thought his doughter shold well be maryed & beset vpon hym / & graumted hym his doughter yf the good lorde the kyng wolde consent therto. And than this Edelwold came agayn to ye kyng & told hym that she was fayre ynough to se vpon / but she was wonders lothly. Than answered the kyng & sayd that he toke but lytel charge. Syr sayd Edelwold / she is her faders heyre / and I am not ryche of londes / & yf ye wolde consent & graunte that I myght haue her / than shold I be ryche ynough. In goddes name sayd ye kyng / I consent therto. Edelwold than thanked the kynge moche / and went agayn in to Deuenshyre and spoused the damoysell / and in that coumtree he dwelled. And thus it befell vpon a tyme that   he tolde his counseyle & all this thynge vnto his wyfe / how & in what maner he had  egyled his lorde the kyng yt wolde haue had her to wyfe. And anone as she it wyst / she loued hym neuer more after warde as she dyd before. This lady conceyued by hym a sone. And whan tyme was that ye chylde shold be borne / Edelwold came to the kyng & prayed hym to heue a sone of his at the fontstone. The kyng hym graumted & let call him Edgar after his owne name. And whan this was done / he thought that al was syker ynough for the kyng / that he wolde not take his wyfe / for as moche as his  lord  was a ioly man and an amerous.  How kynge Edgar wedded Estrylde after the deth of Edelwolde. Hus it befell that all men in king Edgars court than spake & sayd that Edelwolde was rychely auaunced through the maryage of his wyfe / and yet they sayd he was auaunced an hondred folde more / for he had spoused the fayrest woman that euer was seen. And whan the kyng herde speke so moche of her beaute / he thought yt Edelwold had hym deceyued & begyled / and thought pryuely in his herte that he wolde go in to Deuenshyre as it were for to hunt for the harte & for the hynde & other wylde beestes / & than he sholde se there ye lady or he departed the¯s. And this lady was dwellynge at a maner place besyde ye forest where that the kyng wolde hunt / & at that maner he was herborowed all nyght. And whan tyme came that the kyng sholde soupe & the sonne shone / the kynge asked after his gossyp & after his godsone. And Edelwold made her to come before the kyng / & neuerthelesse yf it otherwyse myght haue ben / she sholde not haue comen in his syght by his wyll. The lady welcomed the kyng & swetely hym kyssed. And he toke her by ye hande and nexte by hym her set / and so souped they togyder. And there was a custome and an vsage in this londe yt tyme / that whan one dronke to an other / the drynker sholde saye wassayle / and that other sholde answere and saye / drynke hay e / And thus dyd the kynge & the lady many tymes & also kyssed. And after souper whan tyme was to go to bedde ye kyng went to bedde thynkyng hertely on the fayrnes of that lady / & than was ouercomen for her loue / that hym thought ye he sholde dye / but yf he had his wyll on her. Vpon the morowe the kynge arose and went in ye forest for to dysporte hym with hartes & hyndes & all other wylde beestes / and of ye hartes grete plente he sente to that lady. And thryes he wente to solace & speke with that lady wh es he dwelled there in that countree. And after that the kynge remeued th s / & bethought hym how he myght best delyuer Edelwolde from his wyfe as he had hym fyrst deceyued. And the kynge anone after .viij. dayes let ordeyn a parlyament at Salysbury of all his baronage to haue counseyle & for to ordeyne how the countree of Northumberlonde  shold  best be kepte that the danes came not there to destroye the londe. And this Edelwolde came vnto the kynges parlyament. And the kynge sent hym vnto yorke for to be keper of that countree. And thus it befell that men that knewe hym not slewe hym by the waye. And anone as the kyng herde tell that Edelwolde was deed / he let sende after the fayre lady Estrylde that she sholde come to the cyte of London / and there be wedded to the kynge with grete solempnite and worshyp. And whan he was come to London soone after he helde a sole¯pne feest / and he ware a crowne that was of   golde / & the quene an other. And saynt Dunstan on the morowe came to ye king in his chambre / & foumde the kynge & the quene in bedde togyder. And saynt Dunstan asked the kyng who she was. And the kyng answered & sayd. This is the quene Estrylde. And the archebysshop saynt Dunstan sayd that he dyd grete wronge & agaynst goddes wyll to take a woman to wyfe whose chylde he had holden at ye fontstone. And the quene for that worde neuer loued saynt Dunstan after. And neuertheles ye good ma¯ warned of that foly to be lefte / but it auayled but lytell / for ye loue bytwene them was so moche. The kynge begate vpon her a sone that was called Eldred. Wham this childe was .vj. yere old ye king his fader dyed / & aboute that tyme he had regned xvij. yere / and lyeth at Glastenbury. Eringarius the thyrde was emperour after Henry .vij. yere. this Beringari{us} was emperour in Ytaly / in whose tyme was grete dyuysyon. And Henry ye emperour decessed / & Otto began to regne in Almayne.  Lotherius regned after hym two yere / and decessed whan Otto regned in Almayn / & had a wyfe yt hyght Dalnidam / whiche after wedded Otto.  Beringarius ye fourth was after hy¯. This man wt grete tyranny subdued Ytaly / wherfore the pope & other Romayns called Otto yt he myght delyuer them / whiche he dyd / & he toke Beringary by strength / & twyes he outlawed hym / & he toke Lotherius wyfe whiche ye tyraumt had prysoned.  Leo ye viij. was pope after Benedict{us} one yere & foure monethes. This man was chosen with the comyn voyce / & Iohn was deposed. This Leo ordeyned yt no pope sholde be made without consent of ye emperour / for the malyce of the Romayns the whiche oppressed them. This man graunted all the gyftes to Otto and his successours / the whiche were gyuen by Iustinyan and Karolus to the chirche / that he myght defende Ytaly from ye rebellions.  Ioha¯nes the .xij. was pope after hym almost .viij. yere. This Iohn suffred grete wronge of the Romayns / for he was taken & exiled / but Otto bare this heuyly. For he slewe the noble men of Rome / and certayn of them exiled for euermore.  Benedictus the sixth was pope after hym .vj. yere. This ma¯ was taken / and in the castell Aungell was strangled.  Nota. The empyre this tyme was translated to the Almayns. And the same cause is here as was before / for the vicyous lyuynge. Ne these vnhappy men coude not be enformed / yt they coude eschewe yt one vyce / through ye whiche they sawe so many noble men perysshed.  Otto was emperour after Beringarius .xij. yere. This Otto was the fyrst emperour of Almayne / and he was all vertuous as an other kyng Karolus / for he was the defender of ye chirche of god / and the synguler promoter / for the whiche he was worthy to be emperour. Many men of fals byleue he co¯uerted. And he helde wt hym pope Benedictus the vsurper of the popehede in to Saxony / & there he decessed in his exile And after this Otto the emperour decessed a ryche man in vertue & goodes.  Otto the seconde was emperour after his fader. And he was a noble man to ye chirche as his fader was. And many a batayle he had agaynst fals men of byleue. And at ye last he had almoost lost all his hoost in Kalabre. Yet he for sothe with all his mynde besought saynt Peter to helpe. And meruaylously say¯t Peter delyuered hym. And his wyfe was the doughter of ye emperour of Constantinople of ye Romayns blode / & this man was crowned of Benedictus the pope.  Of saynt Edward the martyr / & how Estrilde his stepmoder let s ee hym for to make Eldred her owne sone kynge. AFter this Edgar regned Edwarde his sone that he begate vpon his fyrst wyfe / that well & nobly gouerned the londe. For he was full of all maner of goodnes / & ladde a full holy lyfe / and aboue all thynge he loued god & holy chirche. And the quene Estrylde that was his stepmoder let slee hym bycause to make her owne sone Eldred kynge / & thus on a day he was slayne as ye shall here afterwarde.  It befell thus vpon a daye that the kynge Edward went in to a wode for to playe in ye south coumtree besyde a towne that is called Warham in whiche forest was grete plente of hartes and hyndes. And wham he had ben a whyle there for to sporte hy¯ / he thought vpon his broder Eldred that was with his moder the quene / for her place was nygh the forest / and thought for to go thyder and vysyte & se his broder. And toke with hym but a lytell meyny / and went towarde his stepmoders hous / yt in that tyme soiourned in the castell of Corfe. And as he rode in the thycknes of the wode to espye his game / it befell that he wente amysse and lost his meyny that came with hym. And at the last he came out of ye wode / and as he loked aboute hym he sawe there fast besydes a maner that his stepmoder dwelled in / and thyderwarde he wente alone. And anone it was tolde the quene / how that the king was comen alone without ony company. And therfore she made Ioye ynough / and thought how she myght do that he were slayn as pryuely as she myght / and she called to her one of her knyghtes / to whome she had tolde moche of her coumseyle bytwene them. And bothe they came to the kyng & curteysly receyued hym. And the kyng sayd that he was comen to visyte her / and also for to speke with Eldred his broder. The quene many tymes thanked hym / and bade hym to alyght & harborowe wt her all that nyght. The kynge sayd that he myght not / but agayn he wold go vnto his folke / yf he myght fynde them. And whan the quene sawe that he wold not abyde / she prayed hym yt he wolde ones drynke. And he graumted her. And anone as ye drynke was come / the que e dranke vnto the kynge. And the kynge toke the cuppe & set it to his mouth / & in the meane whyle that he dranke / the false knyght that was with the quene with a knyfe smote the kynge vnto the herte / and there he fell downe deed from his palfrey vnto the erthe. The quene for this dede gaue the knyght golde and syluer grete plente & of other rychesse ynough. And ye knyght anone as this was done wente hym ouer the see / & so escaped he out of this londe. Whan this kyng Edwarde was thus martyred it was   ye yere of ye incarnacyon of our lorde.  x .C .lxxx. and he had regned .xij. yere and an halfe / and lyeth at Glastenbury.  Of kynge Eldred and how the kyng Swyne of Denmarke held Englond & how Eldred that was saynt Edwardes broder was not beloued in his realme & therfore he fledde in to Normandy. AFter this kyng Edward regned Eldred his broder / & saynt Dunstan crowned hym. And this saynt Dunstan dyed soone after yt he had forgyuen Estrilde the quene her trespace bycause that she was cause of kyng Edwardes deth / and saynt Dunstan had her alloyled & enioyned her penaunce / and she lyued after a chaste lyfe and a clene. This kyng Eldred wedded an Englysshe woman   / & on her he begate Edmund Iren syde / and an other sone that was called Edwyne. And after dyed ye quene theyr moder. And in that tyme came Swyne in to Englonde that was kyng of Denmarke / for to chalenge and conquere all that his auncestres had before ye tyme / And so he conquered and had it all at his askynge. For the good erle Cuthbert of Lyndesey & all the people of Northumlonde and almoost all the gretest men of Englond helde with Swyne that was king of De¯marke / for as moche as they loued not kyng Eldred / bycause that his good broder Edwarde was falsly slayne for the loue of hym / and therfore no man set but lytell by hym. Wherfore kynge Swyne had all his wyll / & toke all the londe. And Eldred the kyng than fledde in to Normandy / and so spake to ye duke Rycharde / that the duke gaue hym his syster Emme to wyfe / vpon the whiche he gate two sones / that one was called Alured / and that other Edwarde. And whan kyng Swyne had conquered all ye londe he regned nobly / & lyued .xv. yere / and than he dyed / and lyeth at yorke.  How kyng Eldred came agayn from Normandy / and how Knoght the Dane regned / and of the warre bytwene hym and Edmunde Irensyde. AFter the deth of Swyne yt was a Dane / Knoght his sone dwelled in Englonde / & wolde haue ben king And than came agayn Eldred out of Nor mandy with a grete nombre of people & a stronge army / that Knoght durst not abyde / but fledde thens in to Denmark. The kynge Eldred had agayne his realme / and helde so grete lordshyp that he began to destroye all those that helped Swyne that was a Dane agaynst hy¯. And afterwarde this Knoght came agayn from Denmarke wt a grete power so that kynge Eldred durst not fyght wt hym / but fledde from thens vnto London / and there helde hym. Than came Knoght and besyeged hym so longe tyll that kynge Eldred dyed in ye cite of London / and lyeth in saynt Paules chirche. And he regned .ix. yere. BOnus was pope after Benedict one yere. This man abode but a lytell tyme.  Bonifacius was pope after hym fyue monethes.  Benedictus was pope after hym .x. yere.

Gregorius the .v. was pope after this man almoost thre yere. This Gregory was made pope at the instaunce of the emperour Otto the thyrde / for he was his cosin. And whan he had ben a lytell whyle pope / and the emperour receded from the cite of Rome Place¯tinus was put in by Crescencius a consull / for money / & than was stryfe a fewe dayes. But the emperour came soone after agayn / & toke Crescencius ye consul & stroke of his heed / & put out the eyen of this man that put out his cosyn of the dignite of the poperyche / & maymed hym in other membres / and his dukes ne his knightes helped hy¯ no thy¯ge For he dyd that thynge that he shold not haue done / and he suffred that that he deserued.  Nota. This Gregory with   the emperour Otto ordeyned there the chosers of the empyre / the whiche from thens forth hath abyden vnto this day. For ye frensshmen nor none other myght not breke ye ordynaunce. And those chosers of the Empyre by the pope & Otto were not made for ony blame of the saxons / but to eschewe the petylles to come And theyr names ben wryten in latyn for lerned men in these verses.

And after he gate the grace of the Emperour / & was made bysshop of Rauennie / & after pope but he had an ende anone / & so haue all that put theyr hope in fals deuyls. Yet men trust in his saluacyon for certayne demonstracions of his sepulture / & for ye grete penaumce yt he dyd in his last ende. For he made his handes & legges to be cut of / & dismenbred all his body / & made them to be cast out at the dore to foules / & than his body to be drawen wt wylde beestes / and there to be buryed where so euer they rested as an houmde.

And his wyues name was San a Ro ogundis with whome he lyued a virgyn all the dayes of his lyfe. And he made many a batayle / as well in ytaly as in Almayn agayust them that rebelled and prospered ryght wysly euermore on them. At the last with a blyssed ende he decessed. And in the lyf of saynt Laurence he and his wyfe be put for ensamples bycause of theyr holy and vertuous lyuynge.  Benedict{us} was pope after Iohn .xi. yere. This man had grete stryfe in his dayes. For he was put out / & an other was put in. And this Benedictus after   that he was deed / was seen of an holy bysshop in a wretched fygure / & he had grete payne. And this fygure sayd he trusted no thynge in the mercy of god / & no thynge profyted hym that was done for hym / for it was goten by extorcyon & vniustly. Than this bysshop lefte his bysshopryche for drede of this sight / & went in to a monastery & lyued vertuously all his dayes.  Ioha¯nes ye .xx. was pope after hym .xi. yere / & lytell profyted.  Of kyng Knoght that was a Dane. ANd after the deth of this Eldred Knoght that was a Daue began to regne. But Edmund Irensyde yt was king Eldredes sone by his fyrst wyfe ordeyned a grete power of men / & began to warre on kynge Knoght. And so he dyd many tymes & ofte / & the warre was so stronge & harde ye wonder it was to wyte And the quene Emme yt than dwelled at westmynster had grete drede of her two sones Alured & Edward / lest they sholde be destroyed through ye warre / wherfore she sente them ouer see in to Normandy to the duke Richard theyr vncle / & there they dwelled in safete & peas lo¯ge tyme.  This Edmund Irensyde & Knoght the Dane warred fyersly togyder. But at ye last they were accorded in this maner / that they sholde departe the realme bytwene them / and so they dyd / and loued togyder lyke two bretherne.  How kyng Edmund Irensyde was slayne through treason by a traytour yt was called Edryth of Stratton. ANd than after regned kyng Edmund Irensyde & Knoght ye dane But thus it befel afterward yt in ye same yere that they were accorded & so moche loued togyder / wherfore a fals traytour had enuy at the loue that was bytwene them / whose name was Edrith of stra to  / that was a grete lorde yt was Edmunde Irensydes man / & of hym helde all the londe that he had / & neuerthelesse he thought to betraye his lorde / & make Knoght kyng of all the londe / to the entent rychely to be auaumced / & with hym to be well beloued. Wherfore he prayed his lorde Edmunde Irensyde on a daye with hym for to ete. And the kyng hym curteysly graumted / and to hym came at his prayer. And at meet the kyng was ryally serued with dyuerse metes and drynkes. And whan nyght came that he sholde go to bedde / the kyng toke his owne meyny and went to the chambre where as he shold take his nyghtes rest And as he loked aboute hym he sawe a fayre ymage & a well made in semblaumt as it were an archer with a bowe bent in his hande / & in ye bowe a fyne arowe. Kynge Edmund went nere to beholde it better. And whan he was by it / anone ye arowe smote hym through the body / & there slewe the kynge / for ye engyn was made to slee his owne lorde traytoursly. And whan kynge Edmund was thus deed & slayne / he had regned but .x. yere And his people made moche sorowe for him / & his body they bare to Glastenbury / & there buryed hym. And this fals traytour Edrith anone went to ye quene that was kynge Edmundes wyfe that wyst not of her lordes deth / & toke from her two sones that were fayre & yonge that her lorde had goten on her / that one was called Edwarde / & that other Edwyne / & ladde them wt hym to London / & toke them to kyng Knoght yt he sholde do with them what his wyl were. And told hy¯ how subtylly he had slayne king Edmund bycause ye Knoght sholde haue all the londe of Englonde.  O thou fals traytoure / hast yu slayne my true broder   that was so true bycause of me / a man that I moost loued in the worlde. Now by my heed I shall for thy trauayle the well rewarde as thou hast deserued / & anone let hym be taken / and boumde hym handes & feet in maner of a traytour / & let cast hym in to the ryuer of Tamyse. And in this maner the fals traytour ended his lyfe. The kyng toke ye two chyldren & put them vnto the abbot of West mynster to warde & to kepe tyll he wyst what was best with them for to do.  How kynge Knoght sent bothe kyng Edmondes sones in to Denmarke for to be slayne / and how they were saued. ANd it befel soone afterward that kynge Knoght had all the londe in his handes: & spoused ye quene Emme through consent of al his barons / for she was a fayre woman / the whiche was Eldredes wyfe / and the dukes syster of Normandy / & they lyued togyder with moche loue as reason wolde. The kyng asked vpon a daye coumseyle of the quene what was best to do wt Edmond Irensydes sones. Syr sayd she / they be the ryght heyres of the londe / and yf they lyue they wyll do you moche sorowe wt warre / and therfore let sende them in to a straumge londe aferre / to some man that may destroye them. The king anone let call a Dane that was called Walgar / & commaumded hym that he sholde lede those two chyldren in to Denmarke / & so to do and ordeyne for them that he sholde neuer more here of them. Syr sayd this Walgar / your commaumdement gladly shall be done. And anone he toke the two chyldren & ledde them in to Denmarke. And for as moche as he sawe that the chyldren were wonders fayre & m ke / he had of them grete pite & ruth / & wold not slee them / but ledde them to ye kynge of Hungary for to nourysshe. For this Walgar was well beknowen with the kynge & well beloued. Anone the kynge asked fro whens the children were. And Walgar tolde hym & sayd yt they were ye ryght heyres of Englonde / and therfore men wolde destroye them / & therfore syr vnto you they be comen to seke mercy & helpe / & for soth yf they may lyue your men they shall become / and of you they shall holde all theyr londe. The kynge of Hungary receyued the¯ with moche honour / and let them worthely be kepte. And thus it befell afterwarde that Edwyne ye yonger broder dyed / & Edwarde the elder broder lyued / a fayre man and a stronge / and a large of body / & gentyll and curteys of condicyons / so yt all men loued hym. And this Edwarde in ye cronycles is called amonge Englysshmen Edwarde the outlawe. And whan he was made knyght / the kynges doughter of Hungary loued him moche for his goodnes and his fayrnes / so that she called hym her derlynge. The kynge that was her fader perceyued well the loue that was bytwene them two / & he had none heyr but onely that doughter. And the kynge vouchedsafe his doughter to no man so well as he dyd to hym that she loued so well / and he her agayn and gaue her vnto hym with a good wyll. And Edwarde her spoused with moche honour. The kyng of Hungary sent after all his barons and made a solemp e feest and a ryche weddynge / and made all men to vnderstande yt this Edwarde sholde be kyng after his decesse of all the londe of Hungary. Of the whiche tydynges they were all ryght glad. And this Edwarde begate vpon this lady a sone the whiche was called Edgar Helyng / and afterwarde a doughter that was called Margarete / that afterwarde was quene of Scotlonde. And by the   kyng of scotlond that was called Mancolin she had a doughter that was called Maud that was quene afterwarde of Englonde through kyng Henry y• was the fyrst sone of the conquerour that her wedded / & he begate on her a doughter that was called Maud / that afterward was empresse of Almayne. And of this Maud came the kyng of Englonde that vnto this daye is called Henry the empresse sone / and yet had this Edwarde an other doughter by his wyfe yt was called Christian / & she was a nonne.  How kynge Knoght yt was a proude man conquered Nor way / and how he became afterwarde meke and mylde. NOw haue ye herde of Edmunde Irensydes sones yt king Knoght wende they had ben slayne as he had co¯ maumded Walgar before. And this kyng Knoght had in his handes all y• realme of Englond & Denmark. And after that they went vnto Norway for to co¯quere that londe. But the kynge of the londe yt was called Elaf came with his people / & wende to haue well kepte & defended his londe / & so there he faught wt hym / tyll at y• last he was slayne in yt batayle. And than this Knoght toke all y• londe in to his ha¯des. And wham he had conquered Norway / & taken feaute & homage there he came agayne in to Englonde / & helde hy¯selfe so grete a lorde / yt hym thought in all the worlde was not his pere / & became so proude & hauteyne that it was grete wonder.  And so it befell vpon a daye as he had herd masse at west mynster / & wolde haue gone in to his palays the wawes of the Tamyse so swyftely came agaynst hym y• almoost they touched his feet. Than sayd y• kyng with a proude herte. I commaunde the water to turne agayn / or elles I shall make the. The wawes for his commaumdement wold not spare / but flowed in heyght more & more. The kyng was so proude of herte that he wold not flee y• water but abode styll in y• water / & bette it wt a yerde y• he had in his hande / & commaumded ye water yt it sholde go no ferder. But for all his commaumdement y• water  wold  not cese / but encreased more & more / so that the kyng was all wete / & stode depe in the water And whan he sawe the water wold not do his commaumdement / he wtdrewe hym & stode vpon a stone / holdyng vp his handes on hye / & sayd herynge all y• people. This god yt maketh y• see thus aryse on hye is kyng of all kynges / & of all mygh tes moost / and I am a caytyf & a deedly man / & he may neuer dye / & all thynge doth his commaumdement & hym obeyeth. To yt god I praye yt he be my warraumt / for I knowlege me a caytyf feble & of no power / & therfore I wyll go vnto Rome without ony longe lettyng / my wycked nes to punysshe / & me to amende. For of god I clay me my londe for to holde / & of none other. And anone made redy his heyre / & hy¯selfe went to Rome without ony lettynge. And by y• waye dyd many almes dedes / & at Rome also. And wham he had ben there & done penaumce for his synnes / he came agayn in to Englonde / & became a good man & an holy / leuyng all maner pryde / & lyued an holy lyfe / & made two abbeys of saynt Benet / one in Englonde / and another in Norway / by cause he loued saynt Benet more specyally than ony other say¯t / & he loued moche also saynt Edmund the kyng / & often he gaue grete gyftes to the hous / & made it ryche. And whan he had regned .xx. yere he dyed / & lyeth at Wynchestre.  Anno dn¯i. M .xviij. BEnedict{us} the .ix. was pope after Iohannes / & he was a grete lethour   / & therfore he was dampned / & he appered to a certayne man vnder a meruaylous fygure & an horryble. His heed & his tayle was lyke an asse / that other part of his body lyke a beer. And he sayd to this ma¯ to whom he appered. Be not aferde / for I was a man as ye be now / but for my beestly lyuynge wham I was pope I appere now lyke a beest.  In this ma¯nes tyme was grete diuisyon & sclaumdre to y• chirche / for he was put out & in two tymes. And here Ptholomeus noteth yt the pryde of bysshops had euer an euyl ende / & it was euer y• occasyon of moche vnrest & batayle.  Co¯radus the fyrst was emperour after Henry .xx. yere This ma¯ made many lawes / & commaumded peas to be kept moost straytly of ony man. But y• erle of Ludolf was accused & he fledde from his londe / & desyred more to lyue lyke a chorle than lyke a gentylman / & yet meruaylously his sone was made emperour by y• commaundement of god agaynst the wyl of Conradus. And at the last they were accorded / & he toke Conradus doughter to his wyfe.  Of kynge Harold that had leuer go on fote than ryde on horsbacke. THis Knoght of whome we haue spoken of before had two sones by his wyfe Emme / yt one was called Hardiknoght / & yt other Harold / & he was so lyght on fote yt men called hym comynly Harold hare fote. And this Harold was no thynge manerd after Knoght his fader / for he set not by cheualry / curteysy / ne worship / but onely by his owne wyll. And he became so wicked yt he exiled his moder Emme. And she went in to Flaumdres / & there dwelled wt y• erle / wherfore he & his broder hated echeother deedly. And whan he had regned ij. yere & more hedyed / & lyeth at West mynster.  Of kynge Hardiknoght that was Haroldes broder. AFter this Harold hare fote regned his broder Hardyknoght / a noble knight & a worthy / & moche loued cheualry and all maner of goodnes. And whan this Hardiknoght had regned a lytell whyle / he let vncouer his broder Harold / & smote of his heed / & made it to be cast in to a gonge / & the body in to Ta myse. And after came fysshers & toke y• bedy with theyr nettes by nyght / & bare hym to saynt Clementes chirche / & there buryed hym. Thus auenged hym Hardiknoght on his broder. Thus kyng Har diknoght was so large a gyuer of meet & drynke / that his tables were set euery daye thre tymes full with ryall metes & drynkes for his meyny & for them that came to his courte. And this kyng Hardiknoght sent after Emme his moder & made her to come agayn / for his broder Harold hare fote had dryuen her out of y• lond through coumseyle of y• erle Godwyn that than was the gretest lorde in Englonde nexte the kynge / & that had moost rule / bycause he had spoused the doughter of kyng Knoght begoten on his fyrst wyfe. And whan this quene was dryuen out of Englond & came to the erle of Flaundres that was called Baldewyne his cosyn foumde her there all thy¯ge that her neded / vnto the tyme that she went agayne in to Englonde / that the kynge Hardiknoght had sent for her that was her sone / and made her to come agayne with moche honour. This kyng Hardiknoght whan he had regned .v. yere he dyed / and lyeth at West mynster.  Of the vylany that the Danes' dyd to the englysshmen / wherfore fro that tyme after was no Dane made kynge of this londe.  AFter the deth of this kyng Hardiknoght for as moche as he ne had no chylde of his body begoten / the  les and barons asseinbled and made a coumseyl / that neuer more after no man yt was a Dane / though he were neuer so grete a man amonge them / he shold neuer be kyng of Englonde for y• despyte yt they had done to englysshmen. For euer more before / yf the englyshmen & the da nes happened to mete vpom a brydge / the englyshmen shold not be so hardy to mene a fote / but stande styll tyll the danes were passed forth. And more ouer yf the englyshmen had not bowed down theyr heedes to do reuerence vnto the danes / they sholde haue ben beten & defouled / & suche despytes & vylany dyd the danes to our englysshmen / wherfore they were driuen out of y• londe after Hardiknoghtes deth. For they had no lorde y• myght mayntayne them. And in this maner auoyded the danes Englonde / that they neuer came agayn. The erles & barons by theyr comyn assent & counseyle sente vnto Normandy for to seke those two bretherne Alured and Edwarde that were dwellynge wt the duke Rycharde y• was theyr vncle / in entent for to crowne Alured the elder broder / & make hym kyng of Englonde / & of this thynge to make an ende. The erles & barons made theyr othe / but the erle Godwyn of Westsex falsly & traytoursly thought to slee these two bretherne anone as they shold come in to Englond / in entent to make Harold his sone kynge / the whiche sone he had begoten on his wyfe kyng Hardiknogh tes doughter y• was a dane. And so this Godwyn went pryuely to southhamton for to mete there with the two bretherne at theyr landynge. And thus it befell yt the messengers yt went in to Normandy foumde not but onely Alured that was y• eldest broder. For Edwarde his broder was gone to Hungary for to speke with his cosyn Edwarde the outlawe y• was Edmund Irensydes sone. The messengers said to Aluted how y• the erles & ba rons of Englond sent for hy¯ / & y• he shold boldly come in to Englo¯de & receyue the realme: for king Hardiknoght was deed & all the danes dryuen out of the londe.  How Godwyn the fals traytour toke Alured vpon Gildesdown whan that he came from Normandye to be kynge of Englonde / & how he caused hym to be martyred in the yle of Ely.   WHan Alured herd these tydy¯ges he thanked god / & toke shyppyng with all y• haste that he myght and passed the see and arryued at south hamton there Godwyn y• fals traytour was. And whan this traytour sawe y• he was comen / he welcomed hym & receyued hym with moche ioye / & sayd yt he  wold  lede hym to London where as all the barons of Englonde hym abode to make hym theyr kynge. And so they went on theyr waye towarde London. And whan they came on Gyldesdowne tho sayd y• traytour Godwyn vnto Alured.   Take hepe aboute you bothe on the lefte syde & on the ryght syde / & of all ye shal be kyng / & of suche an hondred mod Now forsothe sayd Alured / I behyght you and yf I be kyng / I shall ordeyne & make suche lawes / wherof god & man shall be well apayed. Now had the tray tour commaumded all his men that were wt hym / that whan they were comen vpon Gyldesdown that they shold slee all that were in Aluredes company / that came with hym from Normandy / & after that take Alured & lede hym in to y• yle of Ely and after put out bothe his eyen of his heed / & afterward brynge hym to deth. And so they dyd / for they slewe all y• company that were there / the nombre of. xij gentylmen y• were comen with Alured from Normandy / & after they toke Alured & in the yle of Ely they put out his eyen & rent his wombe / & toke y• chefe of his bowels / & put a stake in to the groumde / & an ende of the bowels fastened therto / & with nedyls of yren they pricked y• good thylde / & so made hym to go aboute the stake tyll yt all his bowels were drawen out of his body / & so dyed Alured there through treason of the erle Godwyne. Whan the lordes of Englond had herde and wyst how Alured that sholde haue ben theyr king was put to deth through the fals traytour Godwyne / they were wonders wroth / & swore bytwene them god & his holy name / that he sholde dye a worse deth than dyd Edryth of stration y• had betrayed his lorde Edmund Iren syde / & they wold haue put hym to deth but the traytour fledde thens in to Denmarke / & there helde hym .iiij. yere and more / & lost all his londe in Englonde. SIluester the thyrde was pope after Benedictus. This Siluester was chosen / & Benedict was expulsed. And afterwarde was Siluester expulsed & Benedict was put vp agayn. And after he was put out / & Gregory was made pope / & he was but symple lettred man / and therfore he chose an other pope to be consecrate wt hym. And whan many men were dyspleased with this guydyng of two popes / the thyrde was brought in / the whiche sholde occupy y• place of bothe y• two. And so they stroue amonge them selfe. But Henry the emperour than came to Rome and deposed them all / and made Clement the second pope / whome he made anone to crowne hym. And he sayd to the Romayns they sholde neuer wtout his assent chose pope And so .v. beynge popes / the syxth was put in. But many men saye this Grego ry was an holy man.  Damasus the second was after Clement .xxiij. dayes. This man was an vsurper of y• popery che / & he dyed sodeynly. And anone the Romayns asked to haue a pope / & that the Almayns sholde haue none / for they were so harde herted that they myght not enclyne to the entent of y• emperout the whiche sayd there sholde be no pope chosen but yf he wolde be of counseyle of the eleccyon. But for all that they put in this holy man Leo / and after he had of that conscyence / & refused it. And anone he was chosen by y• comyn assent. This Leo put Chryst in the forme of a lasar in to his owne bedde / and on the morowe he founde no thynge there.  Of saynt Edwarde the confessour that was Aluredes broder / and how he was kynge of Englonde. ANd wham this was done / all the barons of englond sent another tyme in to Normandy y• Edward sholde come in to englond with moche  onout. And this Edwarde in his chyldhode loued   hey god & hym dradde / and in   honeste & clennes ladde his lyfe / & hated synne as deth. And whan he was crow ned & anoynted wt a ryall power / he forgate not his good maners & condicyons that he fyrst vsed / & forgate not all good customes for no maner honour / ne for no rychesse / ne for no maner hygnes. But euer more & more gaue hym to goodnes & well loued god & holy chirche passyng all other maner thynge. And poore men also he loued / & helde them as they had ben his owne bretherne / & to them ofte he gaue grete almes wt full good wyll.  Of the fyrst specyall loue that god shewed to saynt Edward lyuynge. IT befell on a daye as he went from the chirche of westmynster / & had herde masse of saynt Iohn ye euangelyst for as moche as he loued say¯t Iohn the euangelist more specyally after god and our lady / than he dyd ony other saynt. And so there came to hym a pylgrym / & prayed hym for ye loue of god & our lady & saynt Iohn the euangelyst some good for to gyue hym. And the kyng pryuely toke his rynge of his fynger / yt no man perceyued it / & gaue it to the pilgrym / & he it receyued & went thens. This king Edward made all ye good lawes of Englonde / that yet ben moost vsed & holden. And he was so mercyable and so full of pyte / that no man myght be more.  How the erle Godwyn came agayne in to Englonde / and had agayne all his londe / and afterwarde saynt Edwarde wedded his doughter. WHan the erle Godwyn that was dwellynge in Denmark had moche herde of the goodnes of kynge Edwarde / & that he was full of mercy and pyte / he thought yt he wolde go agayne in to Englond for to seke & to haue grace of the good kyng Edward that so mercy full was that he myght haue agayn his londe in peas. And arayed hym as moche as he myght & put hym towarde the see & came in to Englonde to London where ye kynge was that tyme & all the lordes of Englonde & helde a parlyament Godwyn sent to them yt were his frendes / & were ye moost gretest lordes of the lo¯de / & prayed them to beseche ye kynges grace for hym / & that he wolde graunte him his peas & his lo¯de. The lordes lad hy¯ before ye kyng to seke his grace. And anone as ye kyng sawe hym / he appeled hym of treason / & of the deth of Alured his broder / & these wordes to hym sayd Traytour Godwyn I the appele that thou hast betrayed & slayne my broder Alured. Certes syr sayd Godwyn saue your grace & your peas & your lordshyp I neuer betrayed hym /  e yet lewe hy¯. And therfore I put me in reward of the caurte. Now fayre lordes sayd ye kynge / ye that be my lyeges / erles & barons of the londe yt here ben assembled / full well ye herde myn appele / & the answere also of Godwyn / & therfore I wyll that ye awarde & do ryght. The erles & barons than gadred them all togyder to do this awarde by themselfe / & so they spake dy uersly among them / for some sayd there was neuer alyaumce by homage serment seruyce / nor by lordshyp bytwene Godwyn & Alured / for whiche thynge they myght hym drawe. And at the last they deuysed & demed / that he shold put hym in ye kynges mercy all togyder. Than sna ke the erle Leuerike of Couentre a good man to god & to all the worlde / & told his reason in this maner and sayd. The erle Godwyn is ye best frended man of Englonde after ye kyng / & well myght it not be gaynsayd / that without cou se yle of Godwyn Alured was neuer put to deth   wherfore I awarde as touchynge my parte / that hymself & his sone & euery of vs .xii. erles that ben his frendes go before the kynge / charged with as moche golde & syluer as we may bere bytwene our handes / prayenge the kynge to forgyue his euyll wyll to the erle Godwyn and receyue his homage / & yelde agayn his londe. And they accorded vnto that awarde / and came euery of them with golde & syluer as moche as they myght bere bytwene theyr handes before the kynge / and there sayd the forme and the maner of theyr accorde & of theyr awarde. The kyng wolde not them gaynsaye but as moche as they had ordeyned he graumted and co¯fermed. And so was the erle Godwyn accorded with the kynge / and had agayne all his londes. And afterward he bare hym so well & so wysely / that the kynge loued hym wonders moche / & with hym he was full preuy. And within a lytell tyme they loued so moche that ye kynge spoused Godwyns doughter / and made her quene. And neuertheles though the kyng had a wyfe yet he lyued euer in chastite and clennes of body wtout ony flesshely dede doynge with his wyfe. And ye quene also in her halfe ladde an holy lyfe two yere / & dyed And afterwarde the kynge lyued all his lyfe without ony wyfe. The kyng gaue the erledome of Oxford to Harolde that was Godwyns sone / & made hym erle. And so well they were beloued / bothe ye fader and he / & were so preuy with the kynge / yt they myght do by ryght what thynge they wolde. For agaynst ryght wold he no thynge do for no maner man so good and true he was of conscyence. And therfore our lorde Iesu Chryst specyall loue shewed to hym.  How kynge Edwarde sawe  wyne kynge of Denmarke drowned in the see in the tyme of the leuacyon of the sacrament as he stode and herde masse. IT befell vpon a whytsondaye as kynge Edwarde herde his masse in the grete chirche of Westmynster at the leuacion of Iesu Christes body: & as all men were gadred in the chirche / and came nigh the awter for to se ye sacrynge the kyng lyft vp his handes on hygh / & toke vp a grete laughter / wherfore all yt stode aboute hym began gretly to wonder. And after masse they asked why the ky¯ges laughter was. Fayre lordes said kynge Edward / I sawe Swyne ye yonger that was kyng of Denmarke come in to the see wt all his power for to haue comen in to Englond to warre vpon vs / & I sawe hym & all his folke drowned in the see / & all this I sawe in the leuacyon of Chrystes body bytwene the preestes ha¯des / & I had therof so grete wye that I myght not my laughter withholde. And the erle Leuerich stode besyde hym at the leuacion / & openly sawe the forme of breed turne in to ye lykenes of a yonge childe / & toke vp his ryght hande & blyssed the kynge / & afterwarde ye erle / & the erle anone turned hym toward ye kynge for to make hym se that holy syght. And than sayd the kynge. Syr erle I so well that ye se / thanked be god that I haue honoured my god and sauyour vysybly Iesu Chryst in forme of man / whose na me be blyssed in all worldes. Amen.  How the rynge that saynt Edwarde had gyuen to a poore pylgrym for ye loue of god and saynt Iohn the euangelyst came agayne to kynge Edwarde. THis noble man saynt Edwarde regned .xiii. yere. And thus it be fell vpon a tyme or he dyed / ye two men of Englond were gone in to ye holy londe   and had done theyr pilgrymage / & were goynge agayne in to theyr owne coumtree where they came fro. And as they went in the waye / they mette a pilgrym that curteysly salewed them / & asked of them in what londe and in what coumtree they were borne. And they sayd in Englonde Than asked he who was kyng of Englonde. And they answered and sayd / the good king Edward. Fayre frendes sayd the pylgrym / whan that ye come in to your coumtree agayne / I praye you that ye wyll go vnto kyng Edwarde / & greet hym oftentymes in my name / & oftenty mes him thanke of his grete curteysy yt he to me hath done / & namely for ye ryng yt he gaue me whan he had herde masse at Westmynster for saynt Iohns loue ye eua¯gelyst. And than toke ye rynge & toke it to the pylgryms & sayd. I praye you go & bere this ryng / & take it vnto kyng Edward / & tell hym that I sende it hym and a full ryche gyfte I wyll gyue hym For vpom the .xij. daye he shal come to me & euermore dwell in blysse wtouten ende. Syr sayd ye pilgryms / what man be ye and in what coumtree is your dwellynge. Fayre frendes sayd he / I am Iohn the euangelyst / & I am dwellynge with almyghty god / & your kynge Edward is my frende / & I loue hym in specyall for bycause that he hath euermore lyued in clennes & is a clene mayd / & I praye you my message to fulfyll as I haue sayd. Whan say¯t Iohn ye eua¯gelyst had thus charged them / sodeynly he voyded out of bothe theyr sightes. Than thanked ye pylgryms almyghty god & went forth theyr waye. And whan they had gone two or thre myle they began to ware wery / & set them down for to rest them / & so they fell on slepe. And whan they had well slepte / one of them awoke & lyft vp his heed & loked aboute & sayd to his felowe. Aryse vp and go we in our waye. What sayd that our felowe to that other where be we now. Certes sayd ye other / it semeth me yt this is not ye same coumtre that we layde vs  owne in for to rest & slepe. For we were from Ierusalem but thre myles. They toke vp theyr handes and blyssed them / & went forth on theyr waye / & as they went they sawe shepes herdes goyng wt theyr shepe that spake none other language but englisshe. Good frendes sayd one of ye pylgryms / what coumtre is this / & who is lord therof. And anone the shepeherdes answered & sayd This is the coumtree of Kent in Englond of the whiche the good kynge Edward is lorde of. Than the pilgryms thanked almyghty god & saynt Iohn ye euangelyst / & went forth on theyr waye & came to Caunterbury / & from thens to London / & there they foumde the kynge. And tolde hym all from ye begynnynge to the endynge / as moche as saynt Iohn had charged them / & of all thy¯ges how they had spe¯dde by ye waye / & toke ye rynge to kyng Edward / & he receyued it / & thanked almyghty god & saynt Iohn ye euan gelyst. And than made hym redy euery daye from daye to daye to departe out of this lyfe whan god wold send for hym.  How saynt Edwarde dyed on the .xij. daye. ANd after it befel thus on Chryst masse euen as the holy man Edward was at goddes seruyce for to here matyns of ye hygh feest / he became full seke / & on the morowe endured wt moche payne for to here ye masse / & after masse he let hym to be ladde in to his chambre there for to rest hym. But in his hall amonge his barons & knyghtes myght he not come for to comforte them and solace as he was wont to do at that worthy feest. Wherfore all theyr myrth and   comforte amonge all that were in the hall was turned in to care & sorowe / bycause they drad to lese theyr good lorde ye kyng And vpon saynt Iohns daye ye euangelyst that came nexte the kynge receyued his ryghtes of holy chirche / as it befalleth to euery chrysten man / & abode the mercy & the wyll of god. And ye two pylgryms he let come before hym / & gaue them ryche gyftes & betoke them to god And also ye abbot of Westmynster he let come before hym / & toke hym that ryng in the honour of god & saynt Mary & of saynt Iohn the euangelyst. And the abbot toke & put it amonge other relykes / so that it is at Westmynster & euer shall be. And so laye ye kynge seke tyll the .xij. euen / and than dyed the good kyng Edward at Westmynster / & there he lyeth. For whose loue god hath shewed many a fayre myracle. And this was in ye yere of ye incarnacyon of our lorde Chryst Iesu. M .lxv. And after he was translated and put in to the shryne by ye noble martyr saynt Thomas of Caunterbury. Ictor the seconde was pope after Leo / & lytell of hy¯ is wryten.  Henry the seconde was emperour after the first Henry .xvij. yere. This man was cosyn to Conrade / & he was borne in a wode / and twyes taken to be slayne wham he was a childe / but god defended hy¯ euermore. Whan he was made emperour he made a monastery in ye same place in the wode where he was borne. This man was a vicyous man / and he entred in to Ytaly / & there he toke Pandulphus ye prynce of Campany.  Ste phan{us} the .ix. was pope after Victor .ix. monethes.  Benedictus was after hy¯ & he toke the dignite of ye pope Stephen by strengthe / & kepte it .ix. monethes / & than decessed.  Henry the thyrde was emperour after Henry the second. This Henry was an vnquyete man / & many tymes troubled the holy man Gregory the .vij. And fyrst he asked forgyuenes & was assoyled / but he perseuered not / but brought in an other pope agaynst hym / and sayd he was an heretyke. And Gregory cursed hym. And the chosers of the emperour chose the duke of Saxon for to be emperour / whome this Henry in batayle ouercame. And than he came to Rome with his pope / and pursued pope Gregory & the cardynals also. And than anone Robert ye kynge of Naples droue hym thens / & delyuered the pope & his cardynals. Neuerthelesse yet he was a man of grete almes / and .xij. tymes he fought in batayle. And at ye last he dyed wretchedly. For he was put downe by his owne sone. For so as he dyd to other men / so was he done to.  Nycolas the seconde was pope after Benedicte two yere. This Nycolas called a coumseyle agaynst the archedeken of Turonosens whiche was an heretyke / & he taught agaynst the fayth. For he erred in the sa crament / & after he was co¯uerted & was an holy man / but he coude neuer co¯uerte his discyples.  Nota.  Alexander the seconde was pope after hy¯ .xij. yere. This Alexander was an holy man / & he ordeyned that vnder payne of cursynge that no man shold here a preestes masse whome they knewe had a  man. Vt p  xxxij. dist. preter hoc. He had strife wt one Codulo / but he expulsed hy¯ as an vsurper / & put hym out as a symoner.  How Harolde that was Godwyns sone was made kynge / & how he escaped fro the duke of Normandy. Whan  ay¯t Edward was gone out of this worlde / and was passed to god / & worthely buryed as it apperteyned to suche a grete lorde for to be. The   barons of the londe wolde haue had Edward Helingus / sone to Edward y• outlawe that was Edmund Irensydes sone to be kyngr / bycause he was of y• moost kyndest kynges blode of y• realme. But Harold through the erle Godwyn his fader & through other grete lordes of y• realme that were of his kynne / seased all Englonde in to his handes / & anone let crowne hym kyng after the buryenge of saynt Edward.  This Hatold y• was Godwyns sone two yere afore saynt Edward dyed he wold haue gone in to Flaumdres / but he was dryuen by tempest in to the coumtree of Pountyf / & there he was taken & brought to duke Willyam. And this Harold wende that duke Willyam wolde haue ben auenged on hy¯ / bycause that Haroldes fader had let slee Alured saynt Edwardes broder / & pryncypally bycause Alured was sone to quene Emma that was Rychardes moder duke of Normandy y• was grandfader to duke Willyam. Neuerthelesse he dyd not so / for as moche as Harold was a noble & a wyse knight / & that his fader & he were accorded wt saynt Edwarde / therfore he wolde not mysdo hym / but alowed all thynge ordeyned bytwene them. Harold by his good wyll sware vpon a boke & vpon holy saintes that he shold spouse & wedde duke Wyllyams doughter after the deth of saynt Edward / & y• he sholde do his besy cure to saue & kepe y• realme of Englonde vnto y• profyte & auaumtage of duke William. And wham Harold had thus made his othe vnto duke William he let hym go free out of pryson / & gaue hy¯ many ryche gyftes. And than he departed thens & came in to Englond / and anone dyd in this maner wham saynt Edward was deed as a fals forsworne man let crowne hymselfe kynge of Englonde and falsly brake the couenaunt y• he had made before with duke Willyam / wherfore he was wonders wroth with hym & swore that he wolde be auenged vpon hym what someuer hym befell. And anone duke Willyam let assemble a grete hoost & came in to Englonde to auenge hym vpon Harold / & to conquere y• londe yf that he myght.  And in y• same yere that Harold was crowned Harald Hare strenge kyng of Denmarke arryued in Scotlonde / & thought to haue ben kyng of Englonde / & he came in to Englond & robbed & slewe all y• he myght / tyll y• he came to Yorke / and there he slewe a. M. men of armes / and an hondred preestes.  Whan these tydynges came to y• king he assembled a grete power / & went for to fyght with Haralde of Denmarke / & with his owne handes he slewe hym / & the danes were discomfyted. And those that were left alyue with moche sorow fledde to theyr shyppes. And thus kyng Harold of Englonde slewe kyng Harald of Denmarke.  Here came the Normans and expulsed Harold a Saxon.  Wilhelums conquestor.  Anno dn¯i. M .lxvj.  How Willyam bastard duke of Normandy came in to Englonde and slewe kynge Harolde. ANd wham this batayle was done Harolde became so proude that he wolde no thynge parte wt his people   of ony thynge y• he had goten / but helde it all to hymself / wherfore y• moost parte of his people were wroth and departed from hym / so that onely were left with hym but his soudyours.  And vpon a daye as he sate at meet / a messenger came to hym & sayd that William bastard duke of Normandy was arryued in Englonde with a grete hoost / & had taken all the londe aboute Hastynges / & also myned the castell. Whan y• kyng had herde these tydynges / he went thyder with a small power in all the haste y• he myght for there was but fewe people left with hym. And whan he was comen thyder he ordeyned to gyue batayle to the duke Wyllyam. But y• duke asked hy¯ of these thre thynges / yf that he wold haue his doughter to wyfe as he had promysed & sworne his othe / or that he wolde holde the londe of hym in truage / or that he wold determyne this thynge in batayle This Harold was a proude man and a stronge / & trusted moche in his strength and fought with ye duke Willyam & his people. But Harolde and his men were discomfyted in that batayle / & hymselfe there was slayn. And this batayle was ended at Toubrydge in the seconde yere of his regne / vpon saynt Calixtes daye / and so he was buryed at waltham.  Of kynge Willyam bastard / & how he gouerned hym well and wysely / and of the warre bytwene hym & the kynge of Fraunce. WHan Wyllyam bastard duke of Normandy had conquered all y• londe of Englond / vpon Chrystmasse daye nexte folowynge he let hym to be crowned kynge at westmynster / & was a worthy kyng / & gaue to englyssh men londes largely / & to his knyghtes. And afterwarde he went ouer the see & came in to Normandy / & there dwelled a whyle. And in the seconde yere of his regne he came agayne in to Englond / & brought wt hym Maude his wyfe / & let crowne her quene of Englonde on whyt sondaye.  And than anone after y• king of Scotlond that was called Mancolyn began to stryue & warre with the kyng William. And he ordeyned hym toward Scotlond with his men bothe by londe and by see for to destroye kynge Mancolyn. But they were accorded / & the kyng of Scotlonde became his man / & helde all his londe of hym. And king William receyued of hym his homage and came agayn in to Englond. And whan kyng William had regned .xvij. yere / Maude the quene dyed / on whome kynge Wyllyam had begoten many fayre children / that is to saye / Robert Curtoys / William Rous / Rycharde also that dyed / Henry Beauclerk / & Maude also that was the erles wyfe of Bleynes / and other foure fayre doughters. And after his wyues deth there began grete debate bytwene hym & Philyp the kyng of Fraumce. But at the last they were accorded. And than dwelled y• kyng of Englond in Normandy / & no man hym warred / & he no man longe tyme.  And the kyng of Fraumce sayd vpon a daye in scorne of kyng William / y• he had longe tyme lyen in chyldbed / & longe tyme had rested hym there. And this worde came to y• king of Englonde where as he lay in Normandy at Roen. And for this worde was he euyll appayed & also wonders wroth toward the kyng of Fraumce & swore by god that whan he were arysen fro chyldbedde he wolde lyght a thousande candels to the kyng of Fraumce. And anone let assemble a grete hoost of Normans & of Englyssh men. And in the begynnynge of heruest he came in to Fraunce / and brent all the townes that he came by through all the    on¯tree / and robbed & dyd all the sorowe that he myght through out al Fraumce / & at the last he brent the cite of Mandos / & commaunded his people to bere wode & brenne as moche as they myght / & hym self holpe therto all y• he myght wt a good wyll. And there was grete hete what of fyre that was so grete & of the sonne / y• it was wonders hote / & stuffed hy¯ so y• he became & fell in to a grete sekenes. And whan he sawe y• he was so sore seke / he assygned all Normandy to Robert Curtoys his sone / & all Englo¯de to William Rous / & bequethed to Henry Beauclerk all his tresour. And whan he had thus done / he receyued all the sacramentes of holy chirche / & dyed the .xxij. yere of his regne / & lyeth at Cane in Normandy.  Anno domini. M .lxvj. O Regory the .vii. was pope after Alexander .xij. yere. This man ordeined a general sinody / that no preest sholde haue a wyfe / ne shold dwell with women / but those that y• synody of Nicena & other decrees haue suffred. And than the preestes set lytell or nought by his ordynaumce. This man commaunded y• no ma¯ sholde here masse of a preest y• had a co¯cubyne. And he on a certayne tyme as he was cardynall & legate of Fraumce proceded sharply agaynst prelates and preestes y• were symoners. And amonge other there was one bysshop that was gretly famed wt symony / & those y• accused hym he hyred pryuely to saye y• contrary / the whiche y• legate conceyued / & afore all y• people he sayd. Let the iudgement of this man cease at this tyme / for it is deceyuable / & let god dispose for it / & sayd thus. It is certayne that y• dignite of a bysshop is the gyuer of y• holy ghost And who someuer byeth a bisshopryche doth agaynst the holy ghoost. Than yf thou bysshop dyd not agaynst the holy ghoost / saye openly afore all the people Gloria patri et filio / et spiritui saucto. And many tymes he began to saye it / but he coude neuer speke spiritui sancto Than he was deposed of his bysshopryche. And after he coude speke it well ynough.  Victor the thyrde was pope after hym one yere. And this man was poysoned wt venym in y• chalyce.  Vrbanus was pope after hym two yere. This man cursed the kynge of Fraunce for his aduoutry. And he called a counseyle at Clarum / in y• whiche he ordeyned that matyns of our lady sholde be sayd euery daye / and on Saterdaye her solempne masse. And it is sayd that this was shewed vnto the monkes of Charterhous.  Also he called another couuseyle at Turam / for the holy londe to be wonne agayn / & prouoked the people to that thynge. And within a lytell tyme after that / the holy londe was recouered & the gloryous sepulere of our lorde Iesu Chryst / & Anthiochia wt many other noble cytees were taken from y• handes of y• sarasyns. And it is sayd & men byle ued that .CC. M. chryste¯ men went to y• Journey. For there wente of states olde men & yonge / ryche & poore / & no man co¯ pelled them. And this passage was made by y• visyon of our lady. And y• pry¯ces of this people were dyuers. One was Godfrey of Bollyon y• noblest man of all the worlde / & a vertuous man. And an other was Bemond y• duke of Naples. The thyrde was Hugh the kynges broder of Fraumce / & many other the whiche dyd full nobly for the fayth of god. And it were to longe in this boke to recherse the gloryous actes that they dyd.  Of kynge Willyam Rous that was kynge Wyllyam bastardes sone / that destroyed townes & houses of relygyon   for to make the newe forest. ANd after this Willyam bastard regned his sone Willyam Rous This Willyam was a wonders contratyous man to god & holy chirche / & let amende & make y• towne of Cardeis / that the paynyms had destroyed. This king Willyam destroyed holy chirche & theyr possessions in what parte he myght fyn be them. And therfore there was so moche debate bytwene hym and the archebysshop of Caunterbury Ancelme / bycause he cepreued hy¯ of his wyckednes that he destroyed holy chitche. And for y• cause y• kynge bare to hym grete wrath and therfore exiled hym out of this lo¯de And the archebysshop than went to the courte of Rome / & there dwelled with y• pope.  And this kynge made the newe forest / and kest downe & destroyed .xxvj. townes / and .lxxx. houses of religion / all for to make his forest longet & broder / & became wonders proude & gladde of his wode & forest / & of y• wylde beestes that were within it / that it was manuayle to wyte / so that men called hym kepet of wodes & pastours. And the longer that helyued / the more wycked he became / bothe to god & to all holy chirche / & to all his nien.  And this kyng let make the grete hall of Westmynster. So vpon a day at whytsontyde he helde therin his fyrst feest / & he loked aboute hym & sayd that y• hall was to lytell by y• halfedele. And at the last he became so contraryous that all thynge y• pleased god displeased hym / & all thynge y• god loued he hated de dly.  And so it befell that he dremed vpon a night alytel or y• he dyed / that he was let blode / & b dde a grete quantite of blode / & a streme of it  epte  n hye towarde hellen more than    deed fadom / & the clerenes of the daye was   ned vnto  yght & derknes / & the  ament also. And whan he awoke he had grete drede / so that he wyst not what to do / & tolde his dreme to men of his coun seyle / & said that he had grete drede / and supposed that to hym was some myschaunce to come.  And y• second nyght before a monke dremed of the housholde that the kyng went in to a chirche with moche people / & he was so proude / that he despysed all y• people that were with hym / and that he toke the ymage of the crucyfyxe and shamefully bote it with his tethe. And the crucifyxe mekely suffred all that he dyd. But the kynge as a wood man rent of the armes of the crucyfyxe / and kest it vnder his feet and defouled it / and threwe it all abrode. And a grete flame of fyre came out of the crucyfyxe mouth. Of the whiche dreme many men had grete meruayle & wonder.  The good man that had dremed this straumge dreme tolde it to a knyght that was moost preuy with the kynge of all men / & the knyght was called Hanumdes. Soone the monke and he tolde the dreme vnto the kynge / and sayd that it sholde betoken other thynge than good. And neuertheles y• king laughed therac twyes or thryes / and lytell set therby / & thought that he wolde go & hunte and playe in the forest. And men counseyled hym that he sholde not go that daye for no maner thynge / ne come in y• wode / so that he abode at home before meet. But anone as he had eten / no man myght let hym but that he wolde go vnto y• wode for to haue his dysporte. And so it befell that one of his knyghtes that hyghte Walter Tyrell wolde haue shorte to a grete harte / & his arowe glansed vpon a braunche / and through mysauenture smote the kynge vnto the herte. And so he fell downe deed to the grounde without ony worde spekynge / and so ended his lyfe days. And it was no mecuayle   for the daye that he dyed he had let to  erme the archebysshopryche of Caunterbury / and .xij. abbeys also / and euer more dyd grete destruccyon to holy chirche through wrongfull takynge and askyng. For no man durst withsta¯de that he wold haue done / & of his  ewdnes he wolde neuer wtdrawe / neyther amende his lyfe. And therfore god wolde suffre hym no longer to regne in his wyckednes. And he had ben kyng .xiij. yere and vj. wekes / & lyeth at Westmynster.  Anno d i. M .lxxxviij. PAscall was pope after Vrbanus xviij. yere and .v. monethes / the whiche the .xiij. yere of his bysshoprych with his cardynais was put in pryson by the emperour Henry the fourth. And they myght not be delyuered tyll ye pope had sworne yt he sholde kepe peas with hym / & that he sholde neuer curse hym. And on that promesse the pope gaue the emperour a preuylege. And ye yere after the pope dampned that preuplege / and sayd on this wyse. Let vs comprehende all holy scripture the olde testament & the newe / the lawes & the {pro}phetes / the gospell & the canons of apostles / & all the decrees of the popes of Rome / that ye they helde I hold / & that that they dampned I dampne / & moost specially that preuy lege graunted to Henry the emperour / the whiche rather is graunted to venge his malyce / than to multyply his pacyence in vertue / for euermore I dampne that same preuylege.  Of king Henry beauclerke yt was Willyam Rous broder / & of ye debate bytwene hym & Robert Curtoys his broder. ANd whan this Willyam Rous was deed / Henry beauclerk his broder was made kynge / bycause that William Rous had no childe   of his body / & this Henry Beauclerk was crowned kyng at London ye fourth daye after that his broder was deed / that is is saye / the fyfth daye of August.  And anone as Ancelme yt was archebysshop of Caunterbury beynge at the courte of Rome herde tell yt Wyllyam Rous was deed / he came agayne in to Englonde / & kyng Henry Beauclerk welcomed hym honourably. And ye first yere yt he regned he spoused Maude yt was Margaretes doughter the quene of Scotlo de / & the archebysshop Ancelme of Caunterbury wedded them. And this kynge begate vpon his wyfe two sones & a doughter / that is to saye / Willyam & Rychard and Maude. And this Maude was afterwarde the empresse of Almayn. And in the seconde yere of his regne / his broder Robert Curtoys duke of Normandy came wt an huge hoost in to Englond for   chalenge ye londe. But through coumseyle of the wyse men of the londe / they were accorded in this maner. That the kyng shold gyVe his broder ye duke a. M. pound euery yere / & whiche of them lyued longest shold be others heyre / & so bytwene them sholde be no debate nor stryfe. And whan they were thus accorded / ye duke went home agayn in to Normandy. And whan the kynge had regned foure yere there arose a grete debate bytwene hym and ye archebysshop of Caumterbury Ancelme. For bycause that ye archebysshop wolde not graum e hym to take talage of chirches at his wyll / & therfore the archebysshop Ancelme went agayne ouer the see vnto the courte of Rome / & there he dwelled wt the pope. And in the same yere the duke of Normandy came in to Englonde to speke with his broder. And amo¯ge all other thynges ye duke of Nor mandy forgaue vnto ye kyng his broder the foresayd. M. pounde yt he sholde paye   vnto the duke. And with good loue the kyng & the duke departed / and than the duke went agayn in to Normandy. And whan two yere were gone / through the entycement of the deuyll & of lewde men a grete debate arose bytwene the kynge and the duke / so that through counseyle the kynge went ouer the see in to Normandy. And wham the kyng was comen in to Normandy / all the grete lordes of Normandy turned vnto ye kyng of Englonde / and helde agaynst the duke theyr owne lorde / & forsoke hy¯ / yeldyng them vnto the kyng / with all the good castels & townes of Normandy. And soone after was the duke taken & ledde wt the kyng in to Englonde / and the kyng let put the duke in to pryson. And this was ye vengeaumce of god. For whan the duke was in the holy londe / god gaue hym suche myght & grace / that he was chosen for to haue ben kyng of Ierusalem / and he forsoke it / & wolde not take it vpon hym And therfore god sente hym that shame & despyte for to be put in to his broders prison. Than ceased kyng Henry all Normandy in to his ha¯des / & helde it all his lyfe tyme. And in the same yere came ye bysshop Ancelme from ye courte of Rome in to Englonde agayne. And the kyng & he were accorded.  And in ye yere nexte comynge after there began a grete debate bytwene kynge Philyp of Fraumce and kyng Henry of Englond. Wherfore kyng Henry went in to Normandy / and there was  ro¯ge warre bytwene them two. And than dyed the kyng of Fraumce and Lowys his sone was made kynge anone after his dethe. And than wente kynge Henry agayne in to Englonde / & maryed  a de his doughter to Henry the emperour of Almayne.  Of the debate yt was bytwene kyng Lowys of Fraunce and kynge Henry of Englonde / & how kynge Henryes two sones were drowned in the hy  se . WHan kyng Henry had ben kyng xvij. yere / a grete debate arose bytwene kyng Lowys of Fraumce & kynge Henry of Englonde / bycause the kynge had sente in to Normandy to his men that they shold be helpynge vn to the erle of Bloyes as moche as they myght in warre agaynst the kynge of Fraumce / & that they sholde be as redy to hym as they were to theyr owne lorde / for bycause that ye erle had spoused his syster dame Maude. And for this cause the king of Fraumce dyd moche sorowe to Normandy. Wherfore ye kynge of Englonde was wonders wrothe / & in ha  went ouer the see with a grete power / and came in to Normandy for to defende that londe. And ye warre bytwene them lasted two yere / tyll at the last they two fought togyder / and the king of Fraumce was dyscomfyted / and escaped awaye with moche payne / and the moost parte of his men were discomfyted and taken And the kyng dyd with them his pleasure / & some of them he let go frely / and some he let put to deth. But afterwarde the two kynges were accorded. Whan kynge Henry had hoolly all the lo de of Normandy & discomfyted his enemyes of Fraumce / he returned agayn in to Englonde with moche honour. And his two sones Willyam & Rychard wolde haue comen after theyr fader & went to the see with a grete company of people. But or yt they might come to lo¯de ye shyppe stroke agaynst a roche & brake in peces / & were all drowned yt were therin / saue one m  yt was in ye same shyppe y• escaped. And this was on saynt  atherynes daye / & these were ye names of the¯ yt were drowned. Willyam & Rychard ye ky¯ges sones the erle of Chestre Ottonell / his broder   Geffrey rydel / Walter emurci / Godfrey archdeken / the kynges doughter / ye coumtesse of perches / ye ky¯ges nece / ye coumtesse of Chestre / & many other. Whan kynge Henry & other lordes arryued in englo¯de and held these tydynges / they made sorowe ynough / & all theyr myrth & Ioye was turned in to mournynge & sorowe.  How Maude ye empresse came agayn in to englond / & how she was afterward wedded to Geffrey the erle of Angeo.

Celestinus the thyrde was pope after Clemens almost .iij. yere This man was crowned on eester daye & the day folowyng he crowned Henry ye emperour / & he made a palays at saynt Peters / & decessed.  Innocencius the thyrde was pope after hym .viij. yere & v. monethes. This ma¯ was well lettred & he made a boke of the wretchednes of ma¯nes condicyon. And he made speculum misse / and he made many co¯stitucyons. This man dampned the boke of Iohn Ioachim / the whiche he made agaynst mayster Pyers Lombard the maker of the sentence.  This tyme decessed the emperour Henry / and the princes of Almayn dyscorded / for some chose Otto / & some chose Philip broder to Henry. Than Philyp was falsly slayne / & Otto was crowned of Innocent in Fraumce / ye whiche anone gaue batayle to the Romains bycause they gaue hym no due honour. And for ye cause agaynst the popes wyll he toke ye kyngdom of Apulie from Frederyk / wherfore the pope cursed hym. Than after the fourth yere of his regne the prynces of Almayn made Frederyk emperour / and victoryously he subdued Otto.  Wyllyam of Parys this tyme began the ordre of ye freres Austyns / the whiche ben called freres mendicantes.  Fra¯ciscus an ytalyan a man of grete perfeccyon / and an ensample to many a man dyd many a myracle this tyme / & he ordeyned the freres minours.  And the .vj. yere of pope Innocent the thyrd the ordre of the freres prechours began vnder Dominik / but it myght not be co¯fermed tyll the fyrst yere of Honorius.  Of kynge Iohn that in the fyrst yere of his regne lost all Normandy. Bycause kyng Rychard had none heyre sone ne doughter after his deth: they made Iohn his broder king / & crowned hy¯ at Westmynster by Hubert the archebysshop of Caunterbury. And whan he began to regne / he became so meruaylous a man ye he went ouer in to Normandy / & warred vpon ye kynge of Fraumce. And so longe they warred togy der tyll at ye last kyng Iohn lost all Normandy & Angeo / wherfore he was sore anoyed: & it was no meruayle. Than let he assemble before hy¯ at London archebysshops   / bisshops / abbottes & pryours erles & barons / & helde there a grete par lyament / & asked there of the clergy the tenth of euery chirche of Englonde for to conquere Normandy and Angeo agayn that he had lost. They wolde not graumte that thy¯ge / wherfore he was wonders wroth.  In ye same tyme dyed Hubert Than the pryour & the couent of Caunterbury chose agaynst the kynges wyll to be archebysshop mayster Stephen of Langton a good clerke / that dwelled at the courte of Rome / and sent to the pope theyr eletcyon. And the pope confermed it / & sacred hym at Viterbi. Whan the kynge wyst of these tydynges / he was wonders wrothe / & droue the pryour & the coue¯t fro Caumterbury / & exiled them out of the londe / & commaumded ye no lettre nor commaumdement that came fro Rome sholde be receyued ne pleted in Englo¯de. Whan ye pope herd this / he sent to kyng Iohn his lettres / & prayed hy¯ louyngly to receyue Stephen the archebisshop of Caumterbury to his chirche / & suffre the pryour & his monkes to come agayne to theyr owne dwellynge. But the kynge wolde not graumte it for no thynge.  How kyng Iohn wolde no thynge do for ye popes commaumdement / wherfore all Englonde was enterdyted & suspended. ANd at the last ye pope sent by his auctorite / & enioyned to the bysshops of Englonde / ye yf the kyng wolde not receyue the pryour of Caumterbury & his monkes / that they shold do generall enterdytyng through out all Englonde & graumted full power to foure bysshops to pronoumce the enterdytynge yf it were nede. The fyrst was bysshop Wyllyam of London / & that other bisshop Eustace of Ely / the thyrde was bysshop Walter of Wynchestre / & ye fourth was bysshop Gyles of Herford / & these .iiij. bysshops prayed ye kyng knelynge on theyr knees & sore wepyng that he wold do ye popes commaumdement / & shewed hym the popes bulles of ye enterd y¯g. But for no prayer ye they myght praye he wolde not consent therto. wherfore ye bisshops seynge this departed thens / & on ye morowe of ye Annumciacyon of our lady they pronouced ye generall enterdytyng through all Englonde / so ye the chirche dores were shette. Whan ye enterdytyng was pronoumced ye kyng for angre toke the foure bysshops londes in to his handes / & all ye clergy of englo¯de / & ordeyned men to kepe it / ye the clerkes myght not haue theyr lyuynge. Wherfore ye bysshops cursed all them ye shold medle wt the goodes of holy chirche agaynst ye wyll of ye owners. Than the iiij. bysshops seynge ye malyce of ye kyng went ouer ye see to Rome & came to ye archebysshop of Caumterbury / & tolde hy¯ all thyng. And ye archebysshop bad them returne agayn to Caumterbury / & he wolde eyther come or sende to them in his stede ye shold do as moche as yf he hy¯self were there. And whan ye bysshops herde this they returned agayne in to Englonde / & came to Caumterbury. The tydynges came to ye kyng ye the bysshops were come agayn to Caumterbury / & hymself might not come thyder ye tyme / he sente thyder bysshops / erles & abbots for to treate wt them ye the kyng sholde receyue ye archebysshop Stephen / & the pryour & all the monkes of Caumterbury / & ye he shold neuer after ye tyme no thynge take of holy chirche agaynst ye wyll of them ye oweth the goodes / & ye the kyng shold make full amendes to them / of whom he had ony goodes taken / & ye holy chirche shold haue all fraumchyse / as ferforth as they had in saynt Edwardes tyme the confessour.  How Stephen of Langton came agayn in to Englond through ye popes commaumdement / & how he went agayne.   Whan the fourme of accordement was thus ordeyned / it was in a payre of endentures / & they put theyr seales to y• one part / & they y• came in the kynges name put theyr seales to that other parte of the endentures / and foure bysshops a fore sayd toke that one parte of the endentures to them / & that other parte they bare wt them to shewe to the kyng.  Whan the kynge sawe ye forme & vnderstode it / he helde hym full wel apayed of al maner thy¯ges as they had ordeyned / sauynge as touchynge to make restitucyon agayne of the goodes to that thynge he wold not accorde / & so he sent worde agayne to the foure vysshops y• they sholde put out y• one poynt of restitucion. But they answered yt they wold not put out one worde. Than sent the kyng to ye archebysshop by the foure bisshops yt he shold come to Caumterbury for to speke wt hym there / & sent to hym safeconduyt vnder pledges / y• is to saye his iustices Gilbert Poiteuin / William de la Brener / & Iohn fitz Hugh / that in theyr co¯duyt safely he sholde come / & go agayn at his own wyll. And in this ma ner the archebysshop Stephen came to Caunterbury. Whan the archebysshop was comen / the kyng came to Chilham for he wolde come no nere Caumterbury at y• tyme. But he sent by his tresourer bysshop of Wynchestre that he sholde do out of the endentures the clause of restitucyon for to make of ye goodes. And the archebysshop made his othe y• he wolde not do out one worde therof / ne yet chaum ge of that the bysshops had spoken & ordeyned. And than ye archebysshop went agayn to Rome wtout ony more doynge.  Kyng Iohn was than more angryer than euer he was before / and let make a comyn crye through out all Englonde that all those yt had holy chirches rentes & went ouer ye see / that they sholde come agayn in to Englonde at a certayn daye or els they sholde lese all theyr rentes for euer more / & that he commaumded to euery sheryue through out all Englonde / that they sholde enquyre yf ony bysshop / abbot / pryour / or ony other prelate of holy chirche / from that daye afterwarde receyue ony commaundement that cometh fro the pope / that they sholde take ye body and brynge it before hym / and that they sholde take in the kynges handes all theyr lo¯des of holy chirche that were gyuen to ony man by the archebysshop Stephen or by ye pryour of Caumterbury from ye tyme of ye eleccyon of ye archebysshop. And commaumded that all ye wodes yt were the archebysshops  shold  be casten downe to the grounde / and all solde.  How kynge Iohn destroyed the ordre of Cisteaux. ANd in the same yere the Irysshe men began to warre vpon kyng Iohn / & kynge Iohn ordeyned hym for to go in to Irlonde / & let arere an huge taxe through out all Englo¯de / that is to saye .xxxv. thousande marke. And thus   he sente through out all Englonde vnto the monkes of the ordre of Cisteaux that they sholde helpe hy o  .vj. M. marke of syluer. And they answered & sayd yt they durst no thynge do wtout theyr chefe abbot of Cisteaux. Wherfore kynge John whan he came agayn from Irlond dyd them so moche sorow & care yt they wyst not where to abyde / for he toke so moche raumsom of euery hous of them / that the somme amounted to .ix. M. iij .C. marke / so that they were clene lost & destroyed / and voyded theyr houses & theyr londes through out all Englonde. And ye abbot of Wauersay drad so moche his menace that he forsoke ye abbey & went thens / & pryuely ordeyned hym ouer ye see to the hous of Cisteaux. Whan the tydynges came to the pope that ye kynge had done so moche malyce / than was he towarde the kyng full wroth / & sent two legates vnto ye kynge / that one was called Pandulf / & that other Durant / yt they sholde warne the kynge in y• popes name / that he sholde cesse of his persecucyon that he dyd vnto holy chirche / and amende the wronge & the trespace that he had done to the archebysshop of Caumterbury / & to the pryour & to the monkes of Caunterbury / and to all the clergy of Englonde / and that he sholde restore all the goodes agayne yt he had taken of them agaynst theyr wyll / or els they sholde curse hym by name. And to do this thynge & to con ferme / the pope toke them his lettres in bulles patentes. These two legates came in to Englonde / & came to the kynge to Northamton / where as he helde his parlyament / & full curteysly they hym sa lewed & sayd. Syr we come fro ye pope of Rome / the peas of holy chirche and the londe to amende. And we admonest you fyrst in the popes behalfe / that y  make full restitucyon of the goodes y• ye haue rauysshed & taken of holy chirche & of the londe / & that ye receyue Stephen archebysshop of Caumterbury in to his dignite and the pryour of Caumterbury and his monkes / & that ye yelde agayne vnto y• archebysshop all his londes and rentes without ony with holdyng. And syr yet more ouer / that ye shall make rest yon vnto all holy chirche / wherof they shall holde them well apayed. Than answered the kynge as touchynge y• pryour & his mo¯kes of Caumterbury / all y• ye haue sayd I wyll do gladly / & all thynge that ye wyll ordeyne. But as touchynge the archebysshop I shall tell you as it lyeth in my hert. That the archebysshop leue his archebysshopryche / & that the pope than for hym wolde praye / & than vpon auenture me sholde lyke some other bysshopryche to gyue hy¯ in Englonde. And vpon this co¯dicyon I wyll hym accepte and receyue. And neuerthelesse in Englonde as archebysshop yf he abyde / he shall neuer haue so good safeco¯du te but that he shall be taken. Than sayd Pandulf vnto the kynge. Syr holy chirche was neuer wont to discharge an archebysshop without cause reasonable. But euer it hath be wont to chastyse prynces that to god and holy chirche were inobedyent. What how now quod the kynge / menace ye me. Nay sayd Pandulf / but ye now openly haue tolde as it standeth in your herte. And to you we wyll tell what is the popes wyll. And thus it standeth that he hath you holly enterdyted & accursed / for the wronges that ye haue done to holy chirche & to ye clergy. And for as moche as ye dwell & be in wyll to abyde in malyce & in wretchedues / & wyll not come out therof /   to none amendement. ye shall understa¯de that this tyme afterwarde ye sentence is vpom you gyue¯ & holdeth stede & strength & vpon all tho that wt you haue comoned before this tyme / whether they be  es   barons or knyghtes / or ony other what so euer yt they be / we them assoyle safely vnto this daye. And fro this tyme afterwarde of what condicyon someuer that they be / we them accurse that wt you comon ony worde / & we do sentence vpon them openly & specially. And we assoyle clene erles / barons / knyghtes / & all other men of theyr homages / seruyce / & feautees that they sholde vnto you do. And this thynge to co¯ferme we gyue playne power to the bysshop of Wynchestre & to the bysshop of Norwyche. And the same power we gyue in to Scotlonde to ye bysshops of Rochestre & of Salysoury. And in Wales we gyue the same power to ye bysshops of saynt Dauid & of Landaf & of saynt Asse. And more ouer we sende through out all chrystendom / that all ye bysshops beyonde the see / that they do accurse all those that helpe you or yt ony coumseyle gyueth you in ony maner nede that ye haue to do in ony parte of the worlde. And we assoyle all them also by the auctorite of the pope / and commaunde them also with you to fyght as wt hym that is enemy to all holy chirche. Than answered the kynge / what may ye do more to me. Than answered Pandulf / we saye to you in the worde of god / that ye nor none heyre that ye haue / neuer after this day may be crowned. Than sayd the kynge / by hym that is almyghty & I had wyst this afore or that ye came in to my londe that ye had brought me suche tydynges / I sholde haue made you tyde all one yere. Than sayd Pandulf / full well wende we at our fyrst comyng that ye wolde haue ben obedyent to god & holy chirche / & haue fulfylled ye popes commaumdement / & now we haue shewed vnto you & pronounced the popes wyll as we were charged therwith. And as now ye haue sayd / that yf ye had wyst the cause of our comynge / that ye  wold  haue made vs ryde all an hole yere / and as well ye myght haue sayd yt ye wolde haue taken an hole yere of respyte by the popes leue. But for to suffre what deth ye coude ordeyn / we shal not spare for to tell you holly all y• popes message & his wyll / that we were charged with.  How Pandulf delyuered a clerke that had falsed and coumterfeyted the kynges money before the kynge hymselfe. ANd anone the kyng commaunded the sheriues & baylyes of North hamton that were in ye kynges presence that they sholde brynge forth all the prysoners / that they myght be done to deth before Pandulf / bycause ye kyng wende that they wolde haue gaynsayd theyr dedes for cause of dethe all thynge that he had spoken afore. Whan ye prysoners were comen before the kynge / the kyng commaunded some to be hanged / & some to be drawen / & some to drawe out theyr eyen of theyr heed. And amo¯ge all other there was a clerke that had falsed the kynges money. And the kyng commaunded that he sholde be hanged & drawen. And whan Pandulf herde this commaumdement of the kynge / he sterte hym vp ryght quyckly / and anone asked a boke and a candell / and wold haue cursed the kynge / and all them that wold set vpon the clerke ony hande. And Paudulf him self went for to seke a crosse. And ye kyng folowed hym / & delyuered hym ye clerke by ye hande / that he sholde do with hym what he wolde. And thus was ye clerke delyuered & went thens. And Pandulf and Durant his felowe went from the kynge / and came agayne to the pope of Rome / and tolde hym that kynge Iohn wolde not be amended / but euer abode so accursed. And neuerthelesse the pope grasited y• yere through out all Englo¯de   that preestes myght synge masses in co uenable chirches / & consecrate our lordes body / & gyue it to seke men whiche were lykely to passe out of this worlde / & also that men myght thrysten children ouer all ye londe. And whan the pope wyst & sawe yt the kyng wolde not be vnder the rule of holy chirche for no maner thinge the pope than sent to the kyng of fraumce in remissyon of his synnes yt he shold take wt hym all ye power that he myght / & go in to Englonde for to destroye kynge Iohn. Whan these tydynges came to kyng Iohn / than was he sore anoyed & sore drad lest he sholde lese his realme / & hymselfe be done to deth. Than sent he to the pope messengers / & sayd he  wold  be iustyfyed / & come to amendment in all thynges / & wolde make satisfaccyon to all maner men after ye popes ordyuaumce Than sent ye pope agayn in to englonde Pandulf & other messengers / & came to Caumterbury to the kyng / & there abode. And the .xiij. day of Maye ye kyng made an other for to stande to ye popes ordynaum  e before Pandulf the legate / in all maner of thynges in whiche he was accur sed / & that he shold make full restitucion to all men of holy chirche & of religyon & of the goodes that he had taken of them agaynst theyr wyll. And all ye grete lordes of englonde sware vpon the boke & by the holydome / that yf ye kyng wolde not holde his othe / they wolde make hy¯ by strength to holde it. Than the kynge put hym to ye courte of Rome & to ye pope & than gaue he vp ye realme of englonde & of Irlonde for him & for his heyres for euermore that  shold  come after hym / so that kyng Iohn & his heyres shold take those two realmes of the popes handes And sholde euery yere paye ferme vnto the courte of Rome a thousande marke of syluer. And than toke the kynge the crowne of his heed & set hy¯ on his knees and these wordes he sayd in herynge of all the grete lordes of englonde. Here I resygne vp the crowne & the realme of englonde in to the handes of pope Inno cent the thyrde / & put me hooly in to his mercy & in his ordinaumce. Pandulf than receyued y• crowne of kyng Iohn / & kept it .v. dayes as for a seasynge takynge of two realmes of Englonde and Irlonde And confermed all maner thynges by his chartre that foloweth after.  Of the lettre oblygatory that kynge Iohn made vnto the courte of Rome / wherfore the Peter pens ben gadered through out all Englonde. TO all christen people throu h out all the worlde dwellynge. Iohn by the grace of god kynge of Englonde gretynge to your vniuersite. And be it knowen that for as moche as we haue greued & offended god & our moder chirche of Rome. And for as moche as we haue nede vnto ye mercy of our lorde Iesu Chryst / & also we may no thynge so worthy offre as competent sa  to make to god & to holy chirche but   it were our owne body as with  ur realmes of Englonde & of Irlonde. Than by ye grace of god we desyre to meke vs for the loue of hym y• meked hym to the deth vpon the crosse / through counseyle of the noble erles & barons we offre and frely graumte to god & to y• apostles saynt Peter & saynt Paule / and to our moder chirche of Rome / & to our holy fader the pope Innocent the thyrde / & to all y• popes y• come after hym / all the realmes & patronages of chirches of Englo¯de & of Irlonde with theyr appertenaumtes / for remyssyon of our synnes / & for helpe & helth of our kynne soules & all chrysten soules. So y• from this daye afterward we wyl receyue and holde of our moder   thirche of Rome as fee farme / doynge feaute to our holy fader pope Innocent the thyrde / & so to all the popes that cometh after hym in y• same maner aboue sayd. And in y• presence of the wyse man Pandulf the popes subdeken we make lyege homage / as it were in the popes presence & before hym were / and shal do all maner thynges aboue sayd / & therto we bynde vs / & all that cometh after vs & our heyres for euermore / without ony gaynsayenge to the pope / & eke y• warde of chirche vacaumtes. And in token of this thynge euermore for to last / we wyl con ferme & ordeyn / that our specyall rentes of y• foresayd realme / sauynge saynt Peters pens in all thynge to y• moder chirche of Rome payenge by yere a thousan de marke of syluer at two termes of the yere for all maner customes y• we sholde do for y• foresayd realmes / that is to saye at Myghelmasse / and at Eester / that is to saye. vij .C. marke for Englonde / and thre hondred marke for Irlond / sauyng to vs & to our heyres our Iustyces / and our other fraunchyses / & other ryaltees that perteyneth vnto the crowne. And these thynges that before ben sayd / we wyl that it be ferme and stable without ende. And to that oblygacyon we & our successours and our heyres in this maner be bounde / that yf we or ony of our heyres through ony presumpcyon fall in ony poynt agaynst ony of these thynges aboue sayd / and he be warned and wyll not ryght amende hym / he shall than lose the foresayd realmes for euermore. And that this chartre of oblygacyon and our warraumt for euermore be ferme and stable without ony gaynsay enge / we shall fro this daye afterwarde be true to god and to the moder chirche of Rome / and to the pope Innocent the thyrde / and to all them that cometh after hym / and the realmes of Englonde and of Irlonde we shall trewly mayntayne in all maner poyntes agaynst all maner men by our power through goddes helpe.  How the clerkes that were outlawed of Englonde came agayn / & how kynge Iohn was assoyled. WHan this chartre was made & ensealed / the kynge receyued agayne his crowne of Pandulfs hande / & sente anone vnto the archebysshop Stephen / & to all his other clerkes and lewd men that he had exyled out of this londe / that they sholde come agayn in to Englonde & haue agayn theyr londes & also theyr rentes / & that he wolde make restytucyon of the goodes that he had taken of theyrs agaynst theyr wyll The kyng hymselfe than & Pandulf / & the erles & barons went to wynchestre agaynst y• archebysshop Stephen. And whan he was comen the kynge wente agaynst hym / & fell downe to his feet / & thus to hym sayd. Fayre syr ye be welcome / & I crye you mercy bycause that I haue trespaced agaynst you. The archebysshop toke hy¯ vp tho in his armes & kyssed hym curteysly oftentymes / & after ladde hym to the dore of saynt Swythynes chirche by the hande / & assoyled hym of y• sentence / and hym reco¯cyled to god & to holy chirche. And that was on saynt Margaretes daye. And the arche bysshop anone went for to synge masse. And y• kyng offred at the masse a marke of golde. And whan y• masse was done / all they went to receyue al theyr londes without ony maner gaynsayenge. And that daye they made all myrth and ioye ynough. But yet was not y• enterdytynge releaced / bycause y• pope had set that the enterdytynge sholde not be done tyll the kyng had made full restitucyon of y•   goodes that he had take of holy chirche And y• hymselfe sholde do homage to the pope by a tertayne legate that he sholde sende into englonde. And than toke Pandulf his leue of y• kynge & the archebysshop / & went agayne to Rome. And the archebysshop anone let come before him prelates of holy chirche at Redynge for to treate & coumseyle how moche & what they sholde aske of y• kynge for to make restytucyon of y• goodes y• he had taken of them. And they ordeyned & sayd / that the kyng sholde gyue to y• archebysshop thre thousande marke for the wronge y• the kynge had done vnto hym. And also by porcions to other clerkes .xv. M. marke.  And this same tyme Nicolas bysshop of Tuscan cardynall penytencer of Rome came in to Englonde through the popes commaumdement / the .v. kalende of October / & came to London y• .v. nonas of October / for bycause that kyng Iohn & all the kynges y• came after hym shold euermore holde y• realme of Englonde & of Irlonde of god & of the pope / payenge to the pope by yere as is aboue sayd.  How y• enterdytynge was vndone in englonde / & of y• debate y• was bytwene kyng Iohn & the barons of the realme WHan kynge Iohn had done his homage to y• legate y• shewed hy¯ the popes lettre y• he shold paye to Iulyan / and yelde agayne that was kynge Rychardes wyfe y• thyrde parte of the londe of Englonde & of Irlonde y• he had with holden syth that kyng Rycharde dyed. Whan kynge Iohn herde this / he was wonders wroth. For vtterly y• enterditynge myght not be vndone tyll that he had made gree & resticucyon to the foresayd Iulyan of that she asked The legate than went agayn to y• pope after Chrystmasse. And the kynge than sent messengers outr see to Iulian that was kyng Rychard wyfe for to haue a relese of y• she axed of hym.  And so it befell y• Iulyan dyed anone after  ster. And in so moche the kyng was quyte of that thynge that she asked. But than at the feest of saynt Iohn that came nexte after through the popes commaumdement y• enterdityng was fyrst released through out all Englonde the .vij. daye of Iuly. And .vij. yere was the londe enterdited. And on the morow men ronge and sayd masse through out all London / & so after through out all Englonde.  And y• next yere after there began a grete debate bytwene kyng Iohn & the lordes of Englonde / for bycause he wolde not graunte the lawes and holde / the whiche saynt Edwarde had ordeyned / & had ben v ed and holden vnto that tyme that he had them broken. For he wolde holde no lawe but dyd all thynge that hym lyked and dysheryted many men without consent of lordes & peres of the londe. And wold dysheryte y• good erle Radulf of hestre for bycause that he vndertoke hy¯ of his wyckednes / and for cause that he dyd so moche shame & vylany to god & to holy chirche. And also for he helde & haunred his owne broders wyfe / and lay also by maner other women grete lordes doughters / for he spared no woman that hym lyked for to haue. Wherfore all y• fordes of the londe were wroth / & toke the cyte of London. To cease this debate the archebysshop & lordes of the londe assembled before the feest of saynt Iohn baptyst in a medow besyde y• towne of Stanes / that is called Romney mede. And the kynge made them there a chartre of fraunchyse / suche as they wolde aske / and in suche maner they were accorded And that accordement lasted not longe. For the kynge hymselfe soone after dyd agaynst the poynces of y• same chartre   that he had made. Wherfore the moost part of the lordes of the londe assembled them / & began to warre vyon hy¯ agayn and brent his townes & robbed his folke and dyd all thesorowe that they myght and made themselfe as stronge as they myght with all theyr power / & thought to dryue hym out of Englonde / & make Lowys y• kynges sone of Fraumce kynge of Englonde. And than kyng Iohn sent ouer see / and ordeyned so moche people or normans & of pyecardes and of flemmynges / soo that the londe myght not susteyne them but with moche sorowe. And amonge all this people there was a man of Normandye that was called Faukes of Brent / & this Norman & his company spared neyther chirche ne hous of religyon but they brent and robbed it & bare awaye all that they myght take so that y• londe was all destroyed / what on one syde & what on another. The barons and lordes of Englonde ordeyned amonge them the best spekers and wysest men / and sent them ouer the see vnto kynge Philyp of Fraumce / and prayed hym y• he wolde sende Lowys his sone in to Englonde to be kynge of Englonde and to receyue the crowne.  How Lowys y• kynges sone of fraumce came in to Englonde wt a stronge power of people to be kynge of Englonde. WHan kyng Philip of Fraumce herd these tydynges / he made certayn aliaunce bytwene them by theyr comyn eleccyon y• Lowys kynge Philyps sone of Fraumce shold go with them in to Eng londe and dryue out kynge Iohn of the londe. And all that were in the presence of Lowys made vnto him homage and became his men. And the barons of eng londe helde them styll at London / and abode Lowys y• kynges sone of fraumce. And this was the nexte batardaye brfore the Astention of our lorde y• Lowys came into Englonde with a stronge power. And that tyme kynge Iohn had taken all the castelles of Englonde in to alyens handes. And than came Lowys and besyeged  ochesters castell / & toke it with streugthe. And the thursdaye in whytson weke let hange all the alyens that were therin.

How the pope sent in to Englonde a legate that was called Swalo / and of the deth of kynge Iohn. ANd in y• same tyme y• pope sente in to englo¯de a legate y• was called Swalo / & he was preest Cardynall of Rome for to mayntayn kynge Iohns cause agaynst the barons of Englonde. But the barons had so huge party and helpe through Lowys y• kynges sone of Fraumce that kyng Iohn wyst not wheder   to turne ne go. And so it befell that he wolde haue gone to Nycholl / & as he went thyderwarde he came by ye abbey of Swynestede / & there he abode two dayes. And as he sate at meet he asked a monke of the hous how moche a lofe was worth yt was set before hym vpon the table. And the monke sayd that the lofe was worth but an halfpeny. O said the kyng tho / here is grete chepe of brede. Now quod the kynge / & I may lyue suche a lofe shall be worth .xx. shylly¯ges or halfe a yere be gone. And wham he had sayd these wordes / moche he thought & oft he syghed / & toke and ete of the breed and sayd / by god ye wordes that I haue spoken it shall be soth. The monke that stode before ye kynge was for these wordes full sory in his herte / & thought rather he wolde hymselfe suffre deth / and thought how he myght ordeyn therfore some maner remedy. And the monke anone went to his abbot / & was shryuen of hym / and tolde the abbot all that the kynge had sayd / and prayed his abbot for to assoyle hym / for he wold gyue the kynge suche a drynke that all Englonde sholde be glad therof and ioyfull. Than went the monke in to a gardeyn & foumde a grete tode therin / and toke her vp and put her in a cuppe / and prycked the tode through with a broche many tymes tyl that the venym came out on euery syde in the cuppe / and than toke the cuppe & fylled it with good ale / & brought it before the kynge and knelynge sayd. Syr quod he wassayle / for neuer the dayes of your lyf dranke ye of so good a cuppe. Begyn monke quod the kynge. And the monke dranke a grete draught / & after toke the kynge the cuppe / and the kyng also dranke a grete draught & set downe the cup. The monke anone ryght went in to the farmery and there dyed anone / on whose soule god haue mercy Amen. And .v. monkes synge for his soule specyally / and shall whyles the abbey standeth. The kyng arose vp anone full euyl at ease / and commaumded to remeue the table / and asked after the monke. And men tolde hym that he was deed / and that his wombe was broken in sonder. Whan the kynge herde this / he commaumded to trusse / but it was all for nought / for his bely began to swell of the drynke that he had dronken / and within two dayes he dyed / on ye morowe after saynt Lukes daye. And this kynge Iohn had many fayre chyldren of his body begoten / that is to saye / Henry his sone that was kynge after his fader / & Rycharde that was erle of Cornewayle / & Isabel that was empresse of Rome / & Elenour that was quene of Scotlonde. And this kynge Iohn whan he had regned .xvij. yere and .v. monethes and .v. dayes he dyed in the castell of Newarke / and his body was buryed at Worcetter.  Anno domini. M .CC. FRedericus the seconde was emperoure .xxxiij. yere. This man was crowned of Honorius the pope agaynst Otto / bycause y• he sholde fyght with hym / the whiche he dyd / & expulsed hym. And fyrst he nourysshed ye chirche / and after he spoyled it as a stepmoder. Wherfore Honorius cursed hym / & all that were contrary to his opynyon the pope assoyled. And the same sentence Gregorye the .ix. renewed. And this same man put Henry his owne sone in prison / and there murdred hym. Wherfore wham this emperour another season was seke / by another sone of his owne he was murdred / in the tyme of Innocent the fourth.  Honorius the thyrde was pope after Innocent .x. yere / & confermed ye ordre of freres prechours & minours / & made certayne de r alles.  Of kynge Henry the thyrde that was crowned at Glocestre. ANd after this kynge Iohn regned his sone Henry & was crowned at Glocestre whan he was .ix. yere olde / on saynt Symons daye & Iude of Swalo y• legate of Rome / through coumseyle of all the grete lordes y• helde with kyng Iohn his fader / that is to say / the erle Radulfe of Chestre / Wyllyam erle Marshall erle of Penbroke / Willyam y• Brener erle of Feriers. Serle y• manly baron and all the other grete lordes of Englonde helde wt Lowys the kynges sone of Fraumce.  And anone after wham kyng Henry was crowned / Swalo the legate helde his coumseyle at Brystow at saynt Martyns feest / & there were .xj. bysshops of Englonde & of Wales / and of other prelates of holy chirche a grete nombre / and erles & barons and many knyghtes of Englonde / & all those that were at that coumseyle sware feaute vnto Henry the kyng that was kyng Iohns sone.  And anone after y• legate enterdyted Wales / bycause they helde wt the brons of Englonde / also all those that holpe or gaue counseyle to meue warre agaynst y• newe kyng he accursed them And at y• begy¯nyng he put in y• sentence the kynges sone of Fraumce Lowys. And neuertheles y• same Lowys wolde not spare for all that / but went and toke the castell of Barcamstede / & also the castell of Herford. And from y• day afterward y• barons dyd there moche harme through out all Englo¯de / & pryncypally y• frensh men that were with Lowys / wherfore the grete lordes & all y• comyn people of Englond let dresse them for to dryue out of Englonde Lowys and his company But some of the barons & of the frensshe men were gone to the cite of Nycholl / & toke y• towne & helde it to kynge Lowys profyte. But thyder came kynge Henryes men with a grete power / that is to saye / the erle Radulfe of Chestre / and Wylliam erle Marshall / and Wyllyam the brener erle of Feriers / & many other lordes with them / & gaue batayle vnto Lowys men. And there was slayne the erle of Perches / and Lowys men were there foule discomfyted. And there was taken Serle erle of Wynchestre / & Vmfrey de Bowne erle of Herford / & Robert the sone of walter / and many other that began warre agaynst the kynge / there they were taken & ladde vnto kyng Henry y• was kyng Iohns sone. And whan the tydynges came to Lowys of y• disco¯ fyture y• was the kynges sone of fraumce he remeued from thens and went vnto London / and let shette fast the gates of the cyte. And anone after kynge Henry sent to the burgeyses of London y• they sholde yelde them to hym / & the cite also and he wolde graunte to them all theyr fraunchyses that euer they were wont to haue before / & wold co¯ferme them by his grete newe chartre vnder his brode seale.  And in the same tyme a grete lorde that was called Eustace y• monke came out of Fraunce with a grete company of lordes / & wolde haue comen in to Englonde for to haue holpen Lowys the kynges sone of Fraumce. But Hubert of Burgh and the .v. portes with .viii. shyppes tho mette with them in y• high see / and assayled them egerly / and ouercame them with strength / and smote of the heed of Eustace the monke / and toke also .x. grete lordes of fraumce & put them in prison / and slewe almoost all the men that came with them / & anone drowned the shyppes in the see.  How Lowys returned agayne in to Fraunce / and of the confyrmacyon of kynge Iohans chartre.  WHan Lowys herde these tydyn ges he drad sore to be deed & lost and let ordeyn & speke bytwene the kyng & Lowys by y• legate Swalo And through y• archebysshop of Caumterbury & other grete lordes all y• prisoners on that one part & on that other shold be delyuered & go quyte / & Lowys hy¯selfe sholde haue for his costes a. M. pounde of syluer / & sholde go out of Englonde / and neuer come agayne therin. And in this maner was the accorde made bytwene kynge Henry & Lowys. And than was Lowys assoyled of y• popes legate that was called Swalo of y• sentence that he was in / & the barons of Englonde also. And after this kyng Henry & Swalo y• legate & Lowys went to Merton / and there was y• peas co¯fermed & bytwene them ordeyned. And after Lowys went fro thens to London / & toke his leue / & was brought wt moche honour to y• see with y• archebysshop of Caunterbury & with other bisshops & erles & barons / & so went Lowys in to Fraumce.  And afterwarde the kynge & the archebysshop & erles & barons assembled them at London / & at Mighelmas nexte folowynge helde there a grete parlyament / & there were than renewed all the fraumchyses that kynge Iohn had graumted at Romney mede / & kyng Henry than co¯fermed by his chartre / the whiche yet ben holden through out all Englonde. And in y• tyme y• kyng toke of euery plough londe two shyllynges. And Hubert of Burgh was than made chefe iustyce of englo¯de And this was in y• fourth yere of kynge Henryes regne. And in y• same yere was saynt Thomas of Caumterbury translated / the .l. yere after his martyrdome.  And after it was ordeyned by all the lordes of Englonde y• all alyens shold go out of Englonde & come no more therin. And kyng Henry toke than all y• castels in to his handes y• kyng Iohn his fader had gyuen & taken to alyens for to kepe that held wt hym. But y• proude Faukes of Brent rychely let araye his castell of Bedford / whiche he had of king Iohns gyfte / and he helde that castell agaynst kyng Henryes wyl wt might & strength And the kyng came thyder wt a stronge power and besyeged the castell. And the archebysshop mayster Stephen of lang ton with a fayre company of knyghtes came to the kyng for to helpe hym. And from the Ascencyon of our lord vnto the Assumpcyon of our lady lasted y• syege / and than was the castell wonne and taken. And the kynge let hange all those that were gone in to y• castel wich the : good wyll for to hold the castell agaynst hym / that is to say .lxxx. men. And than afterwarde Faukes hymselfe was foumde in a chirche of Couentre / and there i  forsware all Englonde wt moche shame and than wente agayne in to his owne coumtree.  And whyles that kyng Henry regned / Edmonde of Abyndon that was tresourer of Salysbury was consecrate archebysshop of Caunterbury.  And this kynge Henry sente ouer see vnto the erle of Prouance that he sholde sende him his doughter in to Englende that was called El nore / and he wolde spouse her. And so she came in to Englonde after Chrystmas / and on the morowe after saynt Hylaryes daye the archebysshop Edmonde spoused them togyder at Westmynster with grete solempnite. And there was a fayre syght bytwene them / that is for to saye / Edwarde that was nexte kynge after his fader floure of curteysy and of largesse / and Margarete that was afterwarde quene of Scotlonde / and Beatryne that was afterwarde duchesse of Brytayne And Katheryne that dyed a mayde in relygyon.  Of the quinzeme of goodes that were graumted for the newe chartre / and of the purucyaunce of Oxford. ANd thus it befell y• the lordes of Englonde wold haue some addicyons moo in the chartre of fraumchyse y• they had of the kynge / & spake thus bytwene them. And y• kyng graumted them all theyr askynge / & made to them two chartres / y• one is called y• grete chartre of fraumchyses / & that other is called the chartre of forest. And for y• graumt of these two chartres / prelates / erles & barons / & all the comyns of Englonde gaue to y• kynge a. M. marke of syluer.  Whan kynge Henry had ben kynge .xiiij. yere / the same yere he & his lordes / erles & barons of the realme went to Oxford / and ordeyned a lawe in amendement of y• realme. And fyrst sware y• kyng hymselfe and afterwarde all the lordes of y• londe that they wolde holde y• statute for euer more / & who that them brake sholde be deed. But the seconde yere after that ordynaumce / the kynge through coumseyle of syr Edwarde his sone & of Rychard his broder that was erle of Cornewayle / & also of other / repented hym of that othe that he had made for to holde that lawe & ordynaumce / & sente to y• courte of Rome to be assoyled of that othe.  And in the yere nexte comynge after was the grete derth of corne in englonde / for a quarter of whete was worth .xxiiij. shyllynges And the poore people ete nettyls & other wedes for grete honger / & many a. M. dyed for defaute of meet.  And in the xlviij. yere of kyng Henryes regne began warre & debate bytwene hym and his lordes / for bycause that he had broken y• couenaumtes y• were made bytwene them at Oxford.  And in the same yere was the towne of Northamton taken & folke slayne that were within / for bycause y• they had made and ordeyned wylde fyre for to brenne the cite of London.  And in the moneth of Maye that came nexte after vpon saynt Pancras daye / was y• batayle of Lewes / whiche was y• wednesdaye before saynt Dunstans daye / & there was taken kyng Henry hymselfe & syr Edwarde his sone / & Rychard his broder erle of Cornewayl / & many other lordes.  And in the same yere nexte folowynge syr Edwarde the kynges sone brake out of the warde of syr Symon of Moumtford erle of Leycestre at  Herford  / and went vnto the barons of y• Marche and they receyued hym with moche honour.  And the same tyme Gylbert of Clarence erle of Glocestre that was in y• ward also of y• foresayd Symo¯ / through the commaumdement of kynge Henry / that went from hym with a grete herte / for bycause he sayd y• the foresayd Gylbert was a fole in his coumseyle / wherfore he ordeyned hy¯ afterward so / & helde hy¯ wt kyng Henry. And on y• saterdaye next after y• myddes of August syr Edwarde y• kynges sone discomfited syr Symon of Moumtford at Kelinworth / but the grete lordes y• were there wt hy¯ were taken / y• is to saye Baldewyn wake / & William de Moumchensie / & many other grete lordes And y• tewesdaye nexte after was y• batayle done at Eusham / & there was slayne syr Symon of Moumtford / Hugh spenser / & Moumtford that was Rafe Bassets fader of Draiton / and many other grete lordes. And wham this batayle was done all y• gentylmen that had ben wt the erle Symon were disheryted / & they ordeyned togyder & dyd moche harme to all y• lond. For they destroyed theyr enemyes in all that they myght.  Of the syege of Kelynworth / & how the gentylmen were disherited through counseyle of the lordes of the realme of   Englonde / and how they came agayne and had theyr  des. ANd the nexte yere comynge in Maye / the fourth daye before y• teest of saynt Dunstan was the batayle & dyscomfyture at Chest erfelde of them that were disheryted / & there was many of them slayne. And Robert erle of Fe riers there was taken / & also Baldewyn and Iohn de la hay with moche sorowe escaped thens. And on saynt Iohn baptystes eue than nexte folowynge began the syege of the castell of Kenilworth / & the syege lasted to sayne Thomas eue y• apostle / on whiche daye syr Hugh Hastynge had y• castell for to kepe / that yelded vp the castel vnto the kynge in this maner / that hymself & the other y• were within the castell sholde haue theyr lyues & ly¯mes / & all that they had therin / bothe hors & harneys / & foure dayes of respyte for to delyuer clenely y• castell of themself & of all other maner thynge as they had within the castell. And so they went from the castell. And syr Symon de Moumtford y• yonger & the coumtesse his moder were fledde ouer seem to Fraumce & there helde them as people that were exiled out of Englond for euermore. And soone after it was ordeyned by y• legate Dctobone & by other grete lordes y• wysest of Englond / that all those y• had ben agaynst the kynge and were disheryted sholde haue agayne theyr londes by greuous raumsons after y• it was ordeyned. And thus they were accorded with the kynge / & peas was cryed through out Englonde / & thus y• warre was ended. And whan this was done y• legate toke his leue of y• kynge & of the quene & of all the grete lordes of englonde / & tho went to Rome the .lv. yere of kynge Henryes regne. And Edwarde kyng Iohns sone of Brytayne / Iohn  esst / Thomas of clare / Roger of Clifford / Othes of graumston / Robert le Brus / Iohn of verdon / & many other lordes of Englonde & of beyonde the see toke theyr waye towarde the holy londe. And kyng Henry dyed y• same tyme at Westminster wham he had ben kyng .lv. yere & .xix. wekes / on saint Edmondes daye y• archebysshop of Caumterbury. And he was buryed at Westmynster on saynt Edmondes day y• kyng in the yere of our lorde. M .CC .lxxij.  Prophecy of Merlyn of kynge Henry the fyrst expowned that was kynge Iohns sone. ANd of this Henry {pro}phecyed Merlyn & sayd that a  a be sholde come out of Wynchestre in y• yere of our lord. M .CC. and .xvj. with true lyppes & holynes wryten in his herte. And he sayd soth / for y• good Henry y• kyng was borne in wynchestre in y• yere aboue sayd & he spake good wordes & swete / & was an holy man & of good conscyence. And Merlyn sayd y• this Henry sholde make the fayrest place of y• worlde / y• in his tyme shold not be fully ended. And he sayd soth. For he made y• newe werke of y• abbey of say¯t Peters chirche at Westmynster / y• is fayrer of syght than ony other place y• ony man knoweth through out all chrystendom. But kyng Henry dyed or y• werke was fully at an ende / & that was grete harme. And yet said Merlyn that this lambe shold haue peas y• most parte of his regne. And he said soch. For he was neuer noyed through warre ne dyseased in no maner wyse / tyll a lytell before his deth. And Merlyn said in his prophecy more / y• in the ende of y• regne of y• foresayd lambe / a wolfe of a straumge lo¯de sholde do hy¯ moche harme through his war / & y• he shold at y• last be maister through helpe of a reed fore / that sholde   come out of the Northwest &  shold  outr come hym / & that he sholde dryue hym out of the water. And that {pro}phecy full well was knowen. For within a lytell tyme or the kynge dyed / Symonde of Mountforde erle of Leycestre that was borne in Fraunce began stronge warre agaynst hym / through whiche doynge many a good bacheler was destroyed. And whan kynge Henry had y• vyctory at Eusham & Symon y• erle was slayne through helpe of Gylberte of Clare erle of Glocestre / that was in kepyng of the foresayd Symon / through ordynaunce of kynge Henry / whiche went agayne to the kynge with moche power. Wherfore the soresayd Symo¯ was destroyed and that was grete harme to y• comyns of Englonde that so noble a man was slayne for the trouth / & dyed in charite & for the comyn profyte of the same folke. And therfore almyghty god for hy¯ hath sythen shewed many a fayre myracle to dyuers men & women seke for his loue.  And Merlyn also tolde & sayd in his prophecy / that after that tyme y• lambe sholde lyue no whyle / and than his seed sholde be in straumge londe without ony pasture. And he sayd sothe. For kynge Henry lyued no whyle after whan that Symon Moumtford was deed / but dyed anone after hym. And in y• meane tyme syr Edwarde his sone that was the best kynge of y• worlde of honour was than in y• holy londe / & gate there Acres. And in y• coumtree he begate on dame Elenour his wyfe Ihone of Acres his doughter that afterwarde was countesse of Glocestre. And made suche a vyage in y• holy londe that all the worlde spake of his knyghthode / & euery man dradde hym hye and lowe through out all chrystendome / as the story of hym telleth / as afterward ye shall here more openly. And from the tyme y• kynge Henry dyed / tyll that syr G warde was crowned kynge all the grete lordes of englonde were as faderles chyldren without ony socoure that them myght mayntayne / gouerne and defende agaynst theyr enemyes. GRegorye the .ix. was pope after Honory. This ma¯ canonysed many sayntes / and defended myghtely the chirche agaynst Frederyc / therfore toke he many prelates and two cardynalles the whiche wente to counseyle agaynst hym. This pope was besyeged in y• cyte of Rome by the emperour / & he sawe the Romayns were corrupte by the money of the emperour. Than he toke in his hande the hedes of the apostles Peter and Paule / and wente with processyon fro the chirche of saynt Iohn Latrane¯ce to saynt Peters chirche. And so gate he the hertes of y• Romayns. And than the emperour went awaye fro the cite. This pope made frere Iaymonde to compyle the fyue bokes of the decretals of many pystles & decrees. And after with many tribulacyons of this tyraumt & other he decessed & went to heuen  Celestinus y• fourth was pope after Gregory almoost a moneth / & he was in his lyfe & in his connnynge laudable / & he was an olde man & a feble & decessed / & there was no pope after hym almoost a .xij. moneth.

This man canonysed many sayntes / & he deposed y• emperour Frederye & cursed as an enemy to god & y• chirche in y• thyrde yere y• he was made pope / & he was holpen by the Ianuens.  And than was Henry y• syxth chosen & Wylliam by y• popes commaumdement agaynst Frederye one after an other. But they preuayled not to ouercome his tyranny for he was ouer myghty / ne these were not crowned / for they decessed anone.    Thomas de aquino. Albert{us} magn{us}. Eustacius & Bonaue¯ture were this tyme holy men / whiche destroyed moche heresy infected by y• emperour.  Alexander was pope after Innocent .vij. yere / & lytel of hy¯ is wryten.

The pope gaue y• kyngdom of Cicyle to the kynges broder of fraumce / y• he sholde fyght wt Maufred / & than decessed. And Maufred after lost his lyf & his kyngdon by Karol{us}.  Alphonsus kyng of Castil & Rychard broder to y• kyng of englonde were chosen emperours / but Rycharde dyed / & Alphonsus renoumced his tytle of the empyre before Gregory the .ix. for he was a wytty ma¯ & a noble astronomer / & his tables be very famous.  Clemens the .iiij. was pope after Vrban .iij. yere & .ix. monethes. This Clemens was an holy man / & sayd by spiryte of {pro}phecy y• the enemyes of y• chirche shold perysshe as y• smoke. And it is to be byleued that god cessed y• tribulacyons of his chirche through his merites. He had afore a wyfe & children / & was a preest after & bysshop & legate / & beynge in englonde vnknowen to hy¯ was chosen pope / & after for his vertuous lyfe decessed blyssedly.  Gregory y• .x. was pope after hy¯ .iiij. yere. He assembled a co¯cyle at Loduum in fraumce for y• grete desyre y• he had to vysyte personally y• holy londe / in y• whiche concyle y• Grekes & the Tartares were / and there y• Grekes {pro}mysed to be reformed by y• vnite of y• chirche. And y• Tartares newly baptysed promysed y• same And there were gadered. vj .C. bisshops & a. M. prelates. And therfore a certayn ma¯ sayd. Gregory gadereth togyder all ky¯des of people. And there was decreed y• all persones & vycayres shold be called preestes / & no prelates / & y• no man shold assygne his tythes to what chirche he wolde / as they dyd afore / but they shold be payed to his moder chirche. And he dampned y• pluralite of bn¯fyces / & dyed a blyssed man.  Innocent the .v. was after hym .v. monethes / and lytell dyd.  Adrian was after him one moneth / & dyd lesse.  Iohn the .xxj. was after hy¯ viij. monethes / & he was i diuers seyences a famous man / but in maners a fole & decessed anone.  Nycolas y• .iij. was pope after Iohn .j. yere. This man was in his dayes a noble ma¯ in buyldyng / & wel gouerned y• ci e all his dayes & y•.  j yere he dyed.  Rodulphus was emperour .xviij. yere. This man was cr  of Hauesburgh / a wyse man in armes noble & victoryous / & was chosen at bastle & he toke y• crosse on hym for y• holy londe The imperyall blessyng he had not but the pope alowed y• eleccyon for fauour of the holy londe.

He cursed y• emperour of  o¯sta tynople in so moche as he promysed to turne to y• fayth in the generall concyle & dyd not / for y• whiche he suffred many passyons & all holy chirche. Also he cursed y• kyng of Aragon for he expulsed y• kyng of Cicyle fro his kyngdom. And after he had done many batayles agaynst men of misbyleue / & had suffred many tribulacyons he decessed & dyd many myracles.

Nicolaus y• fourth was pope after hym foure yere. this ma¯ was a frere minor / & al though he was a good man in hy¯self / yet many vnhappy thy¯ges fell in his tyme to the chirche / for many a batayle was in y• cite through his occasyon / for he drewe to moche to y• one parte / and after hy¯ there was no pope two yere & .vj. monethes.  Of kynge Edwarde that was kyng Henryes sone. And of his ryalte.   ANd after this kyng Henry regned Edward his sone / the worthyest knyght of all y• worlde in honour For goddes grace was in hy¯ / for he had y• victory of his enemyes. And as soone as his fader was deed he came to London with a fayre company of prelates & of erles & barons / & all maner men dyd him moche honour. For in euery place y• this noble Edward rode in London the stretes were couered ouer his heed with ryche clothes of sylke / of tapysserye and with ryche couerynges. And for ioye of his comynge the burgeyses of the cyte cast out at theyr wyndowes golde & syluer handes full / in tokenynge of loue & worshyp / seruyce & reuerence. And out of y• condyth of chepe ran whyte wyne & reed as stremes of water / & euery man dranke therof that wolde at theyr owne wyll. And this kynge Edwarde was crowned & anoynted as ryght heyre of Englonde with moche honour. And after masse y• kyng went in to his palays for to holde a ryall feest amonge them y• dyd hym honour. And wham he was set to mete / kynge Alexander of Scotlonde came for to do hym honour & reuerence with a queyntyse / & an .C. knyghtes wt hym well horsed & arayed. And whan they were alighted they let theyr stedes go wheder they wolde / & who y• myght take them / had them styll wtout ony chalengynge. And after came syr Edmonde kynge Edwardes broder a curteys & a gentyll knyght / & y• erle of Cornewayle & y• erle of Glocestre / & after them came the erle of Penbroke / & y• erle of Gare¯ne. And eche of them by themselfe ladde in theyr hande an .C. knyghtes gayly disguysed in theyr armes. And whan they were alyghted of theyr horses / they let them go wheder they wold / & who that myght them catche / them to haue styll wtout ony chalenge. And whan all this was done / kynge Edwarde dyd his dylygence & his myght for to amende & redresse y• wronges in the best maner y• he myght / to the honour of god & holy chirche / & to mayntayne his honour / & to amende the noyaumce of y• comyn people.  How Ydeyne that was Lewelyns doughter of Wales / and Aymer that was the erles broder of Mountforde were taken on the see.  THe fyrst yere after that kyng Edwarde was crowned / Lewlyn prynce of Wales sent in to Fraumce to the erle Mountford / that through coumseyle of his frendes the erle sholde wedde his doughter. And the erle than auysed hym vpon this thynge / & sent vnto Lewlyn and sayd that he wolde sende after his doughter. And so he sent Aymer his broder after the damoysell. And Lewlyn arayed shyppes for his doughter & for syr Aymer / & for her fayre company y•  shold  go with her. And this Lewlyn did grete wronge / for it was a couenaunt that he sholde gyue his doughter to no maner man without coumseyle & consent of kynge Edwarde. And so it befell that a Burgeys of Brystowe came in the see laden with wyne / & mette them / & toke them with myght and power. And anone the Burgeys sent them to the kyng. Whan Lewlyn herde these tydynges he was wonders wroth & also sorowfull / & began to warre vpon kynge Edward / and dyd moche harme to Englysshe men / & bette downe the kynges castels / & began fast for to destroye kyng Edwardes londes. And whan the tydynges came vnto the kynge of this thynge / he went in to Wales / & so moche he dyd through goddes grace and his grete power that he droue Lewlin to grete myschefe / that he fledde all maner strength & came & yelded hym vnto kynge Edward / & gaue hym .l. M. marke of syluer to haue peas / & toke the damoysell & all his herytage / & made an obly gacyon to kyng Edward to come to his parlyament two tymes in the yere.  And in the seconde yere after y• kynge Edward was crowned / he helde a generall parlyament at Westmynster / & there he made the statutes for defaute of lawe by the comyn assent of all his baronage. And at eester nexte after the kynge sent by his lettre vnto Lewlyn prynce of Wales that he  shold  come to his parlyament for his londe / & for his holding of Wales as the strength of the lettre oblygatory wytnessed. Than Lewlyn had scorne & despyte of y• kynges commaumdement. And for pure wrath agayn began warre vpon kynge Edward / & destroyed his londes. And whan kyng Edward herde of these tydy¯ges / he waxed wonders wroth vnto Lewlyn / & in haste assembled a grete power of people & went towarde Wales and warred so vpon Lewlyn the prynce tyll y• he brought hym in moche sorow & dysease. And Lewlyn sawe that his defence myght not auayle hym / and came agayn & yelded hym to y• kynges grace / & cryed him mercy / & longe tyme kn led before y• kynges feet. The kynge  ad of hym pyte / & commaumded hym to a se / & for his mekenes forgaue hy¯ his wrathe and to hym sayd / that yf he trespaced agaynst hy¯ an other tyme / that he wolde destroye hy¯ for euermore. Dauid y• was Lewlins broder y• same tyme dwelled wt kyng Edward / & was a fell man and a subtyll / & enuyous / & also ferre castynge and moche treason thought / & euermore made good semblaunt / & semed so   y• no man myght perceyue his falsnes.  How Lewlyn through  gg nge of his broder Dauid warred agayn vpon kynge Edwarde. IT was not longe tyme that tyme that kynge Edward gaue to Dauid Lewlyns broder the lordship of  rodesham / and made hym knyght. And so moche honour dyd he neuer after to no man of Wales bycause of hym.  Kyng Edward helde his parlyament at London whan he had done in Wales al that he wolde / & chaumged his money y• was foule kyt & roumded / wherfore the people co¯playned sore / so y• the king let enquyre   of ye trespassours. And .ccc. were atteynted of suche maner of falsnes / wherfore some were hanged / and some drawen & hanged. And afterward the kyng ordey ned / that ye sterling halfpeny & ferthyng sholde go through out all his londe. And commaumded yt no man fro that daye afterwarde gaue ne  eoffed hous of religyon with londe or tenement / without specyall leue of ye kynge / & he yt dyd / sholde be punysshed at the kynges wyll / & the gyfte sholde be for nought.  And it was not longe after that Lewlyn prynce of Wales through ye entycement of Dauid his broder / and by bothe theyr consent they thought to dysheryte kynge Edward in as moche as they myght / so yt through them bothe ye kynges peas was broken And whan kyng Edward herde of this anone he sent his barons in to Northum berlonde & the surreys also / yt they shold go & take theyr vsage vpon ye traytours Lewlyn & Dauyd / & wonders harde it was for to warre than. For it is wynter in Wales / whan in other coumtrees it is somer. And Lewlyn let ordeyne & well aray & vitayle his good castel of Swandon / and therin was an huge nombre of people & plente of vitayles / so that kyng Edward wyst not where to entre. And whan ye kynges men it perceyued / & also ye strength of Wales / they let come in to ye see barges & botes & grete plankes as many as they might ordeyne & haue for to go to the foresayd castell of Swandon wt men on fote & also on hors. But ye Walshmen had so moche people & were so stronge / yt they droue ye Englysshmen backe / so yt there was so moche prees of people at the turnynge agayn / that the charge & the burden of men made ye barges & botes to synke / & there was drowned many a good knyght / yt is to say / syr Roger Clifford / syr William of Lindsey that was syr Iohns sone fitz Robert / & syr Rychard Tanny / & an huge nombre of other / & all was through theyr owne foly / for yf they had had good spies they had not ben harmed. Whan kynge Edward herde tell that his people were so drowned / he made sorowe ynough. But than came syr Iohn of Vessye from the kynge of Aragon / & brought with hym moch people of bachelers & of Gascoyns & were soudyours & dwellynge wt Iohn of Vessye / & of hym receyued wages / & of hym were holden / & were noble men for to fyght / and brent many townes / & slewe all ye walshmen that they myght take. And all those wt strength & myght made assaute vnto the castell of Swandon / & gate the castell. And wham Dauid herde of these tydynges / he ordeyned hy¯ to flyght. Wham Lewlyn ye prynce knewe that his broder was fledde / than was he sore abasshed / for he had no power his warre to maynteyn. And so Lewlyn began to flee / & wende well to haue scaped But in a mornyng syr Roger Mortimer mette wt hym onely with .x. knightes / & set hym roumde aboute / & to hym went & smote of his heed / & presented it to kyng Edward. And in this maner Lewlyn ye prynce of Wales was taken / & his heed smytten of / & also all his heyres dysheryted for euermore / through ryghtfull dome of all the lordes of the realme.  How Dauid yt was Lewlyns broder prynce of Wales was put to deth. DAuid ye prynces broder of Wales through pride wende to haue be¯ prynce of Wales after his broders deth / And vpom this he sent after walshmen to his patlyament at Dinbigh / & folysshly made Wales to aryse agaynst ye kyng / & began to meue warre agaynst kyng Edward / & dyd all ye sorowe & dysease that he myght by his power. Whan kynge   Edward herde of this thynge / he ordey ned men to pursue vpon hym. And Dauid fyer y hym defended / tyll yt he came to ye towne of saynt Morite / & there was Dauid taken as he fledde / & ladde to the kynge. And the kyng commaumded that he shold be hanged & drawen / and smyte of his heed / & quarter hy¯ / & sende his heed to London / & the foure quarters to the foure chefe townes of Wales / for they sholde take ensample therof & be ware. And afterward kynge Edward let crye his peas though out al wales / & seased all ye londe into his handes / & all ye grete lordes that were lefte alyue came to do feaute & homage to kynge Edward / as to theyr kynde lorde. And than let kynge Edward amende the lawes of Wales yt were defectyue. And after he sent to al ye lordes of Wales by his lettres patentes yt they sholde come all to his parlyament. And whan they were comen the kynge sayd to them full curteysly. Lordes ye be welcome / & me behoueth your coumseyle & your helpe for to go in to Gascoyn / for to amende ye trespace that to me was done whan I was there / & for to entreate of peas bytwene ye kynge of Aragon & the pry¯ce of Morrey. And all ye kynges liege men erles & barons consented & graumted therto. And than kynge Edwarde made hym redy & went in to Gascoyn / & let amende all ye trespaces yt was done hy¯ in Gascoyn. And of ye debate that was bytwene ye kyng of Aragon & the prynce of Morrey he cessed & accorded them. And whyle kynge Edward & quene Elenore his wyfe were in Gascoyn / the good erle of Cornewayle was made wardeyn of Englonde tyll that kyng Edward came agayn. And than enquyred he of his tray tours yt coniected falsnes agaynst hym. And eche of the¯ all receyued theyr dome after that they had deserued. But in the meane tyme whyle that kyng Edward was beyonde yt see to do them for to make amendes yt had trespaced agaynst hy¯ there was a fals traytour yt was called  isap Meridoc began to make warre agaynst kynge Edward / & that was for cause of syr Payne Tiptot ye wrongfully greued & diseased ye foresayd Bisap Meridoc. And whan kynge Edward herde all this / he sente by his lettres to Bisap Meridoc that he sholde make no warre but that he sholde be in peas for his loue & whan he came agayne in to Englonde he wolde vndertake ye quarell & amende all that was mysdone. This foresayd Risap Meridoc despysed the kynges commaundement / & spared not to do all the sorowe that he myght to ye kynges men of Englond. But anone after he was taken & ladde to yorke / and there he was drawen & hanged for his felony.  Of the redressyng that king Edward made of his Iustices and of his clerkes that they had done for theyr falsnes / and how he droue ye Iewes out of Englonde for theyr vsury and mysbyieue. WHan kynge Edward had dwelled thre yere in Gascoyn / a desyre came to hy¯ for to go in to Englonde agayn And whan he was comen agayn there were so many co¯playntes made to hym of his Iustices & of his clerkes that had done so many wronges & falsnes / that wonder it was to here. For whiche falsnes syr Thomas weylonde the kynges Iustyce forswore Englonde at ye Toure of London / for falsnes that men put vpon hym / wherof he was atteynt & proued fals. And anone after whan the kynge had done his wyll of the Iustices than let he enquyre & espye how the Iewes deceyued & begyled his people through theyr synne of falsnes & of vsury / and let ordeyn a preuy parliament amonge his   lordes. And they ordeyned amo¯ge them that all ye Iewes shold voyde out of Eng lo¯de for theyr misbyleue & also for theyr false vsury that they dyd vnto chrysten men. And for to spede & make an ende of this thynge / all the comynalte of Englonde gaue vnto the kynge the .xv. peny of al theyr goodes mouable. And so were the iewes dryuen out of Englonde. And than went ye iewes in to Fraumce / & there they dwelled through leue of kyng Philyp that than was kynge of Fraumce.  How kynge Edwarde was seased in all ye londe of Scotlonde / through consent and graumte of all ye lordes of Scotlonde. IT was not longe after ye Alexander kyng of Scotlonde was deed and Dauid the erle of Huntingdon that was the kynges broder of Scotlond asked & claymed ye kingdom of Scotlonde after that his broder was deed / bycause that he was rightfull heyre. But many grete lordes sayd naye / wherfore grete debate arose bytwene them & theyr fren des / for as moche as they wolde not con sent to his crownacyon. And the meane tyme the foresayd Dauid dyed. And so it befell yt the sayd Dauid had thre dough ters that worthely were maryed. The fyrst doughter was maryed to Bayloll / the seconde to Brus / & the thyrde to Hastynges. The foresayd Bayloll & Brus chalenged ye londe of Scotlonde / & grete debate & stryfe arose bytwene them thre bycause eche of them wolde haue ben kyng. And whan ye lordes of Scotlonde sawe ye debate bytwene them / they came to kyng Edward of Englonde / & seased hym in all ye londe of Scotlonde as chefe lord. And whan the kyng was seased of the foresayd lordes of Scotlonde / ye foresayd Bayloll / Brus / & Hastynges came to the kynges courte / & asked of ye kynge whiche of them sholde be kyng of Scotlonde. And kyng Edward that was full gentyll & true / let enquyre by the cronycles of Scotlonde / & of the gretest lordes of Scotlonde / whiche of them was of ye eldest blode. And it was foumde yt Bayloll was the eldest / & that the kyng of Scotlonde shold holde of ye kyng of Englonde and do hym feaute & homage. And after this was done Bayloll went in to Scotlonde / and there was crowned kynge of Scotlond. And ye same tyme was vpon the see grete warre bytwene ye englyssh men & the Normans. But vpon a tyme the Normans arryued at Douer / & there they martyred an holy man yt was called Thomas of Douer. And afterward were the Normans slayne / yt there escaped not one of them.  And soone after kynge Edward sholde lese the duchy of Gascoyn through kyng Philip of Fraumce / through his fals castyng of ye Dou e peres of the lond / wherfore syr Edmond that was kyng Edwardes broder gaue vp his homage vnto ye kyng of Fraumce.  And in yt tyme ye clerkes of Englonde graumted to kynge Edward halfe dele of holy chirche goodes / in helpynge to recouer his londe agayn in Gascoyn. And the kynge sent thyder a noble company of his bachelers. And hymselfe wolde haue gone to Portesinouth / but he was letted through one Maddok of Wales yt had seased the castell of Swandon in to his handes / & for that cause ye kyng turned to Wales at Chrystmasse. And bycause that the noble lordes of Englond yt were sent in to Gascoyn had no comfort of theyr lorde the kyng they were taken of syr Charles of Fraumce / that is to say / syr Iohn of Brytayne / syr Robert Typtot / syr Raufe Tanny / syr Hugh Bardulf / & syr Adam of Cretynge. And yet at ye Ascencyon was Maddok taken in Wales & another whiche was called Morgan /    and they were sent to the toure of London / and there they were byheded.  How syr Iohn Bailoll kyng of Scotlonde withsayd his homage. ANd wham syr Iohn Bailoll kyng of Scotlonde vnderstode yt kyng Edwarde was warred in Gascoyne (to whome ye realme of Scotlonde was delyuered) falsly than agaynst his othe wtsayd his homage through procuryng of his folke / & sent vnto the courte of Rome through a fals suggestion to be assoyled of the othe yt he swore vnto the kynge of Englonde. And so he was by lettre embulled.  Than chose they of Scotlonde Douspers for to take from Edward his ryght.  And in yt tyme came two cardynals from Rome fro ye pope Celestyne to treate of accorde bytwene the kyng of Fraumce & the kyng of Englonde. And as those cardynals spake of accorde / Thomas Turbeluyl was taken at Lyons & made feaute & homage to the warden of Parys / & to hym put his two sones in hostage / & thought to go in to Englonde for to espye the coumtre / & tell them whan he came in to Englonde yt he had broken the kynges prison of Fraumce by nyght / & sayd that he wolde do yt all englysshmen & walshmen sholde be aboute ye kyng of Fraumce. And this thynge to bryng to an ende he swore / & vpon this couenaumt dedes were made bytwene them / & that he sholde haue by yere a. M. poundes worth of londe to bry¯ge this thynge to an ende. This fals traytour toke his leue & went thens & came in to Englo¯de vnto ye kyng & sayd yt he was broken out of pryson / & that he had put hy¯ in suche peryl for his loue / wherfore ye kynge coude hy¯ moche thanke / & full glad was of his comynge And the fals traytour fro yt daye espyed all the doynge of ye kynge & also his coumseyle / for the kynge loued hym well / and was wt hym full preuy. But a clerke of Englonde yt was in the kynges hous of Fraumce herde of this treason & falsnes / & wrote to an other clerke that than was dwellyng wt kyng Edward of Englonde all how Thomas Turbeluyll had done his fals conife tynge / & all the coumseyle of Englonde was wryten for to haue sent vnto ye king of Fraumce. And through the foresayd lettre that ye clerke had sent fro Fraumce / it was foumde vpon hym wher fore he was / ladde to London and there hanged and drawen for his treason. And his two sones that he had put in Fraum  for hostage were than byheded.  Of the conquest of Barwyk. ANd whan the two cardynalles were gone agayn in to Fraunce for to treate of the peas of Cambrey the kyng sent thyder of his erles & barons that is to saye / syr Edmonde his brod  erle of Lancastre & of Leycestre    en ry Lacy erle of Nycholl / & W yam  ss  a baron / and of other baronettes aboute xiiii. of the best and wysest of Englonde. And in ye same tyme kyng Edward toke his viage to Scotlo¯de for to warre vpon Iohn Bayloll kyng of Scotlonde. And syr Robert Roos of Batwyk dedde fro ye englysshmen and went to the Scottes. And kyng Edward went toward Barwyk & besyeged the towne. And they yt were within manly defended them & set a fyre and brent two of kyng Edwardes shyppes / & sayd in despyte & repre e of hym. Weneth kyng Edward with his longe shankes to haue gete Barwik all our vnthankes / gas pykes hy¯ / & whan he has done gas dikes hy¯. Whan kyng Edwarde had herde this s orne / anone through his myght he passed ouer the dyches & assayled the towne / and came to the gates and gate and conquered the   towne / & through his gracyous power slewe .xxv. M. and. vij .C. Scottes. And kynge Edward lost no man of renome / saue syr Richard of Cornewayle / & hym slewe a flemynge out of ye reed hall with a quarell as ye foresayd Rycharde dyd of his helme & commaumded them for to yelde them & put them in the kynges grace / & the Scottes wolde not / wherfore ye hall was brent & cast downe / & all those that were therin were brent. And kyng Edward lost no moo men at that vyage of symple estate but .xxvij. Englysshmen. And the wardeyn of the castell gaue vp the keys of the castell wtout ony assaute / & there was taken syr William Douglas & syr Symond Ft sell & the erle Patrik yelded them to the peas. But Ingham of Humsremyll & Robert the Brus that were with kyng Edward / forsoke kyng Edward & helde with the Scottes / and afterwarde they were taken & put in to prison. And than let kyng Edward close in Barwik with walles & with dyches And afterwarde Robert Rous went to Tyndale / & set waybrygge a fyre & Exham & Lamerstok / & slewe & robbed the folke of yt coumtre. And after that he went fro thens to Dunbar. And ye fyrst wednesdaye of Marche ye kyng sent ye erle of Garenne / syr Hugh Percy / & syr Hugh Spenser wt a fayre company for to besiege the castell. But one yt was called syr Rychard Syward a traytour & a fals man ymagyned for to begyle ye englysshmen and sent to ye englysshmen for to deceyue them / & sayd that he wold yelde to them the castell / yf they wold graumt hym. viij dayes of respyte / that he myght sende & tell to syr Iohn Bayloll that was kyng of Scotlonde / how his men fared that were within ye castell / & sent hym worde but yf he wolde remeue the syege of the englysshmen / that they wolde yelde the castell to the englysshmen. The messenger than came vnto syr Iohn Bailoll (ye than was kynge of Scotlonde) where as he was with his hoost / and the messenger tolde hym all the case. And than syr Iohn Bayloll toke his hoost & came on the morowe erly towarde the castell. And syr Rychard Sywarde sawe hym come that was mayster of the coumseyle and keper of ye castell / and sayd vnto the Englysshemen. O quod he / now I se a fayre company and well apparayled / I wyll goo agaynst them and mete with them / and assayle them. And syr Hugh Spenser sawe the falsnes of hym & the treason / and sayd to hym. O traytour taken and proued / your falsnes shall not auayle you. And syr Hugh Spenser commaumded anone for to bynde hym / and in all haste went agaynst theyr enemyes / and slewe of the Scottes the nombre of xxij. M. For the Scottes had that tyme no man with them of honour / saue syr Patryk Graham that manly fought & longe / & at the last he was slayne. And than sayd the englysshmen in reprefe of the Scottes. These scaterand Scottes holde I for sottes of wrenches vnware. Erly in a mornynge in an euyll tymyng went ye fro Dunbare.  Whan those yt were in the castell sawe the dysco¯fyture they yelded vp the castell to ye englysshe men / and boumde theyr bodyes londes & castels to kynge Edward. And so there were taken in ye castell thre erles .vij. ba rons / and .xxviij. knyghtes / and .xj. clerkes / and .vij. Pycardes / & all were presented to kyng Edward / & he sent them to ye toure of London to be kepte there.  How kynge Edward of his grete grace delyuered agayne the Scottes out of pryson that were chefetaynes of the londe / and they drewe them to the Frensshmen through the coumseyle of Wyllyam Waleys.  THan whan kynge Edward had made an ende of the warre & taken the chefetaynes of Scotlond. Than came syr Iohn Bayloll wt other & yelded them vnto kyng Edward & put them in his grace / & were ladde to London. And wham kyng Edward was comen thyder they were brought before hy¯ / & ye kynge asked of them how they wolde make amendes of the trespace & losse yt they had done him / & they put them in his mercy Lordes sayd the kyng / I wyll not your londes ne your goodes / but I wyll yt ye make to me an othe vpom goddes body to be true to me / & neuer after this tyme agaynst me bere armes. And they all consented to the kynges wyll / & swore vpon goddes body / yt is to say / syr Iohn of Comyn / ye erle of Strathorne / ye erle of Ca yk / & also .iiij. bisshops vndertoke for al the clergy / & so ye kynge delyuered them and gaue them safeconduytes to go in to theyr owne coumtree. And it was not lo¯ge afterwarde but that they arose agaynst kyng Edward / bycause that they wyst well that kynge Edwardes folke were taken in Gascoyn / as before is sayd / but syr Iohan Bayloll kynge of Scotlonde wyst well that his londe sholde haue sorowe ynough & shame for theyr falsnes / and in haste went hym ouer ye see to his owne londes / and there helde hym / and neuer came agayne. Wherfore ye Scottes chose vnto theyr kyng Willyam Waleys a rybaud and an harlot / comen vp of nought / & to englysshmen dyd moche harme.  And kyng Edward thought how he myght best delyuer his people that were taken in Gascoyne / & in haste went hym ouer the see in to Flaundres for to warre vpon the kyng of Fraunce. And the erle of Flaumdres receyued hym with moche honour / & graumted hym all his londes at his owne wyl. And whan the kyng of Fraumce herde tell yt the kyng of Englond was arryued in Flaumdres & came wt an huge power to destroye hym he prayed hy¯ of trewse for two yere / so ye englysshe marchaumtes and also frensshe myght safely go & come on bothe sydes. Kynge Edwarde graumted it / so yt he had his men out of prison yt were in Gascoyn And ye kyng of Fraumce graumted anone / & so they were delyuered.  In the same tyme the Scottes sent by the bysshop of saynt Andrewes in to Fraumce to ye kyng & to syr Charles his broder yt syr Charles shold come wt his power and they of Scotlond wolde come wt theyr power & so they sholde go in to Englonde ye lond  to destroye from Scotlond vnto  en  & the scottes trusted moche vpon ye frenssh men. But of yt thy¯ge they had no maner graumte. Yet neuerthelesse ye Scottes began to robbe & slee in Northumberlonde and dyd moche harme.  How Willyam Waleys let slee syr Hugh of Cressingham / and of the batayle of Fonkirke. WHan the tydynges came to kyng Edward that Wyllyam Waleys had ordeyned suche a stronge power & also that all Scotlonde to hym was attendaunt & redy for to slee Englysshmen and to destroye the londe he was sore anoyed / & sent anone by lettre to ye erle of Garren / & to syr Henry Percy and to syr Willyam Latomer / and to syr Hugh of Cressyngham his tresourer that they sholde take power & go in to Northumberlonde / & so forth in to Scotlond for to kepe the coumtrees. And whan Willyam Waleys herde of theyr comynge / he began for to flee / & ye englysshmen folowed hym / & droue hym tyll he came to S ry uelyn / & there he helde hym in ye castell. And the walshmen euery daye them escryed & thretened / & dyd all the despyte that they myght / so yt the Englysshmen   vpon a tyme in a mornyng went out from the castel the mountenaumce of .x. myle / & passed ouer a brydge. And William Waleys came with a stronge power & droue them backe / for the englysshmen had no power agaynst hym but fledde / & they yt myght take the brydge escaped. But syr Hugh the kynges tresourer there was slayn & many other also / wherfore was made moche sorowe.  Than had kyng Edward spedde all his maters in Flaumdres & was comen agayn in to Englo¯de & hastely toke his waye in to Scotlonde & came thyder at ye Ascencyon tyde / & all that he foumde he set a fyre & brent. But ye poore people of Scotlonde came to hym wonders thycke / & prayed hym for goddes loue to haue mercy on them. Wherfore the kyng commaumded yt no man shold do them harme yt were yolde¯ to hym / ne to no ma¯ of ordre / nor no hous of religion ne no maner chirche / but let espye where yt he myght fynde ony of his enemyes. Than came a spye to ye kynge & tolde hy¯ where the Scottes were assembled for to abyde batayle. And so on saynt Mary Magdaleyns day ye kynge came to Fonkirk & gaue batayle to ye Scottes / & at ye batayle were slayne .xxxiij.

For whan William Waleys fled from ye batayle / that same Brian hym pursued fyersly / & as his hors ran he start in to a myre of a marys vp to ye bely / & Willyam Waleys than turned agayne / and there slewe syr Bryan / & yt was grete harme. And that whyle kynge Edwarde went through Scotlonde for to enquyre yf he myght fynde ony of his enemyes / & in ye londe he dwelled as longe as hym lyked & there was none enemy that durst him abyde. And soone after yt kyng Edward went to Southamton / for he wolde not abyde in Scotlond in wynter season for esement of his people. And whan he came to London / he let amende many my  dedes that were done agaynst his peas & his lawes whyle he was in Flaumdres  Of the last maryage of kyng Edward / and how he went the thyrde tyme in to Scotlonde. ANd afterward it was ordeyned through the court of Rome / that kyng Edward  shold  wedde dame Mar garete that was kyng Philips syster of Fraumce. And the archebysshop Robert of wynchelse spoused the¯ togider / through whiche mariage there was made peas bytwene kynge Edward of Englonde & kynge Philyp of Fraumce.  Kynge Edwarde went than the thyrde tyme in to Scotlond. And than wtin ye fyrst yere he famysshed the londe / so yt he lefte not one but that al came to his mercy / saue they that were in ye castell of Estreuelyn / that well was vitayled & stored for .vij. yere.  How the castell of Estreuelyn was besyeged and wonne. BYnge Edward came to the castell of Estreuelyn wt an huge power & besyeged the castell / but it lytel auayled For he myght do the Scottes no harme the castell was so stronge & well kepte. Whan kyng Edward sawe that / he bethought hym on a queyntyse / & caused anone to make two payr of hye galowes before the toure of ye castell / & made his othe / that as many as were within the castell (were he erle or baron) & he were taken with strengthe (but yf he wolde the rather yelde hym) he sholde be hanged vpon ye same payr of galowes. And whan they that were within the castell herde this / they came and yelded them   all to the kinges grace & mercy. And the kyng forgaue them all his yll wyll. And there were all ye grete lordes of scotlonde sworne to kynge Edward / yt they sholde come to London to euery parlyament / & sholde stande to his ordynaunce. How Troylebaston was fyrst ordeyned. BYng Edward went thens to London / & wende for to haue had rest & peas of his warre / in yt whiche warre he was occupyed .xx. yere / that is to say in Wales / in Gastoyn & in Scotlonde / & thought how he myght recouer his tresour yt he had spended about his warre And let enquyre through ye realme of all the tyme yt he had ben out of his realme that men called Troylebaston / & ordeyned therto Iustices. And in this maner he recouered tresour wtout nombre. And his purpose was for to haue gone in to the holy londe for to haue warred vpon goddes enemyes / bycause he was crossed longe tyme before. And neuertheles the lawe yt he had ordeyned dyd moche good through out all Englonde to them that were mysbode. For those yt trespaced were well chastysed / & afterwarde were moche more meker & better / & the poore comyns were in rest & peas. And ye same tyme king Edward prisoned his owne sone Edwarde / bycause ye bysshop of Chestre ye kynges tresourer had complayned on hy¯ / sayeng yt he through coumseyle of one Pyers of Ganaston a squyer of Gascoyn had broken his parkes. And this Pyers coumseyled & ladde this same Edward. And for this cause kynge Edward exiled this Pyers out of Englo¯de.  Of the deth of Willyam Waleys the fals traytour. ANd whan this kynge Edward had ouercomen his enemyes in Wales / Gascoyn & Scotlonde / & had destroyed all his traytours / saue onely ye rybaud Willyam Waleys / ye neuer wolde yelde hym to ye kyng / & at ye last he was taken in the towne of saynt Dominyk / the .xxxiij. yere of king Edwardes regne & was presented to kyng Edward. But the kyng wolde not se hym / & sent hym to London to receyue his iudgement / & vpom saynt Barthylmewes euen he was hanged & drawen / & his heed smytten of and his bowelles taken out of his body and brent / & his body quartred & sent to foure of the best townes of Scotlonde / & his heed put vpon a spere & set vpom London brydge / in ensample yt the Scottes sholde haue in mynde for to do amysse agaynst theyr lyege lorde agayne.

And they were accorded with ye kyng & bounde / & by othe swore that yf ony of them afterward mysbare them agaynst the kynge / they sholde be disheryted for euermore. And wham theyr peas was thus made / they toke theyr leue & went home vnto theyr coumtree.  How Robert the Brus chalenged Scotlonde. ANd after this Robert the Brus erle of  aryk sent by his lettres vnto the erles and barons of Scotlonde that they shold come to hym to Sconne on the morowe after the Coucepcyon of our lady for the grete nedes of the londe.   And the lordes came at ye daye assygned. And the same daye syr Robert the Brus sayd. Fayre lordes full well ye knowe yt in my persone dwelleth the ryght of the realme of Scotlonde / & as ye well wote I am ryghtfull heyre / syth yt syr Iohn Baylon that was our kynge hath forsaken vs & left his londe. And though it so be that kyng Edward of Englond with wrongfull power hath made me assent to hym agaynst my wyll / yf yt ye wyll graunt yt I may be kynge of Scotlonde I shall kepe you agaynst king Edward of Englonde / & agaynst all maner men. And with yt worde the abbot of Sconne arose vp & before them all sayd yt it was reason for to helpe hym & defende ye londe & sayd he wolde gyue hym a. M. pounde for to maynteyn ye londe. And all ye other graumted hym the londe / and with theyr power hym for to helpe / & defyed kynge Edwarde of Englonde / & sayd yt Robert the Brus sholde be kyng of Scotlonde.  How syr Iohn of Comyn gaynsayd the crownynge of syr Robert the Brus.  Ordynges sayd syr Iohn of Comyn / thynke on ye trouth & othe that ye made to kyng Edward of englo¯d & as touchyng my selfe I wyll not breke myn othe for no man / & so he went from them / wherfore Robert ye Brus & all tho that consented to hym were yll content wt syr Iohn of Comyn. Than ordeyned they another coumseyle at Domfris / to which came ye foresayd syr John of Comyn / for he dwelled but two myle from Domfris there he was wont to soiourne & abyde.  How syr John of Comyn was traytoursly slayne. ANd wham Robert the Brus wyst that all the grete lordes of Scot lo¯de were come to Sco¯ne / saue syr Iohn of Comyn that than abode nygh Sco¯ne he sent specially for the sayd syr Iohn of Comyn to come & speke with hym. And vpon that he came & spake wt him at the gray freres in Domfris / & that was the thursday after Candelmasse daye / & syr Iohn graumted to go wt hym. And whan he had herde masse / he toke a soppe and dranke / & afterward he bestrode his pa  frey & rode to Domfris. Whan Robert the Brus sawe hym come at a wynow as he was in his chambre / he made toye ynough / & came agaynst hym / & colled hym about the necke / and made to hym good semblaumt. And whan all the erles and barons of Scotlond were there present / Robert ye Brus sayn / syrs ye wote well the cause of this comynge / & wher fore it is / yf ye wyll graumte that I may be kyng of Scotlonde as ryght heyre of the londe. And all ye lordes yt were there sayd wt one voyce yt he sholde be crowned kyng of Scotlond / & yt they wolde helpe hy¯ & maynteyn agaynst all men lyuyng & dye for hym yfnede were. The gentyl knyght Iohn of Comyn answered. Cet tes neuer for me: ne for to haue as moche helpe of me as ye value of a button / for ye othe yt I haue made to kyng Edward of Englond I shall holde whyle yt my lyfe lasteth. And with ye word be went from the company & wolde haue lepte vpon his plafrey. And Robert the Brus pursued hym with a drawen swerde and perced hym through the body / & syr Iohn Comyn fell downe to the erth. But whan Roger yt was syr Iohn Comyns broder saw ye falsues / he stert to Robert ye Brus & smote hym wt a knyfe / but ye traytour was armed vnder / so yt the stroke might do hym no harme / & so moche helpe came aboute Robert ye Brus / yt Roger Comyn was there slayne & hewen to peces And Robert ye Brus turned agayn where as syr Iohn Comyu the noble baron   laye wounded and drewe towarde his deth besydes the hye awter in ye chirche of the gray freres / & sayd vnto syr Iohn Comyn. O traytour thou shalte be deed and shalt neuer lette myn auauncement and shoke his swerde at the hye awter and smote hym on the heed yt the brayne fell downe vpon the groumde / & the blode stert on hygh vpon the walles. And yet vnto this daye is that blode seen there / & no water may wasshe it awaye / & so dyed that noble knyght in holy chirche.  Whan this traytour Robert ye Brus sawe yt no man wold lette his crownacio¯ he commaumded all ye barons to be at saynt Iohns town at his crownacion. And on the Annumciacion of our lady ye bisshop of Glaston & ye bysshop of saynt Andrewes crowned hym kyng. And anone after he droue all the Englysshmen out of Scotlonde. And they fledde and came & complayned them vnto kyng Edward how that Robert the Brus had dryuen them out of the londe & dysheryted them.  How that kynge Edward dubbed at Westmynster .xxiiij. score knyghtes. ANd whan kyng Edward herde of this myschete / he swore yt he shold be aue¯ged therof / & hange & drawe all the traytours of Scotlonde without raumsom.  Than kyng Edward sent for all the bachelars of Englond / that they shold come to London at whytsontyde / & he dubbed at Westmynster .xxiiij. score knyghtes. Than ordeyned he to go in to Scotlonde agaynst Robert the Brus / & sent before hy¯ in to Scotlond syr Aymer the valyaumt erle of Pembroke / & syr Henry Percy baron wt a fayre company / yt pursued ye Scottes & brent townes & castlels And afterwarde came ye kyng hymselfe with erles & barons a fayre company.  How Robert the Brus was dyscomfyted in batayle / & how Symond Frisell was slayne. THe frydaye nexte before the Assumpcyon of our sady kyng Edward mette with Robert ye Brus & his company besyde saynt Iohns to  ne in Scotlonde / of yt whiche company kyng Edward slewe .vii. M.  Whan Robert the Brus sawe this myschefe / he began to flee & hyd hy¯ secretiy / but syr Symod Frisell was fore pursued / so yt he turned again & abode batayle / for he was a wor thy knyght / but our englysshman shewe his hors & toke hym & led hym to kynge Edward / but or he came to hy¯ he began to flatre his takers / pmysyng them. iiij M. marke of syluer / his hors &  arneys & become a begger. Than said Theobald of Peuenes that was ye kynges arther. Now so god me helpe it is for nought yt thou spekest / for all ye golde in englend I wold not let the go wout commaumdement of kynge Edward. And kynge Edward wolde not se hym / but commaumded to lede hym to London to haue his dome. And on our ladyes eue the Nat  he was hanged & drawen / & his herd smytten of & hanged agayne with chaynes of  ren vpon the galowes / & his herd was set vpon London brydge on a spere and agaynst Chrystmasse ye body was brent / bycause that the men that kepte ye body by nyght sawe so many deuylles aboure hym / turmentynge hym wt yren crokes hortybly vpon ye galowes & many that sawe them anone after dyed for drede / & some waxed mad / or fore seke. And in yt batayle was taken ye bysshop of Baston & ye bisshop of saynt Andrewes & ye abbot of Sconne all armed as fals traytours & fals prelates agaynst theyr othe. And they were brought to ye kynge. And the kynge sent them vnto the pope of Rome that he sholde do wt them his wyll.  How Iohn erle of Atheles was taken and put to deth. ANd at yt batayle fledde syr Iohn erle of Atheles / and went in to a chirche / & there hyd hym for drede / but he myght haue there no refute / bycause that ye chirche was enterdyted through a generall sentence / & in ye same chirche he was taken. And this syr Iohn wend well to haue scaped fro ye deth / bycause yt he claymed kynrede of kynge Edward. And ye kyng wold no longer be betrayed of his traytours / but sent hy¯ to London in haste / & there was hanged & his heed smytten of / & his body brent. But at the prayer of the quene Margarete bycause yt he claymed kynrede of kyng Edward his drawynge was forgyuen hym.  How Iohn that was Wyllyam Waleys broder was put to deth. ANd whan the gretest maysters of Scotlonde were thus done to euyll deth for theyr falsnes and treason / Iohn that was Willyam Waleys broder was taken and done to dethe / as syr Iohn erle of Atheles was.  How Robert the Brus fledde from Scotlonde to Norway. ANd at that same tyme was Roberte the Brus moche hated amonge the people of Scotlonde / so that he wyst not what was best to do / & for to hyde hym he went in to Norway to ye kynge yt had spoused his syster / & there helde hy¯ for to haue socour. And Robert the Brus myght not be founde in Scotlonde. So kynge Edward than let crye his peas through out all the londe / and his lawes were vsed / & his mynystres serued through out all the londe.  How kynge Edwarde dyed.   ANd whan kynge Edwarde had abated the pride of his enemyes he returned agayne south warde / and a malady toke him at Burgh vpom saudes in the marche of Scotlonde / & he wyst well that his deth was full nygh / & called to him syr Henry Lacy erle of Nichol syr Guy erle of warwik / syr Aymer Valence erle of Penbroke / and syr Robert of Clifford baron / & prayed them vpon the fayth yt they ought hym / that they shold make Edwarde of Carnaruan kynge of Englonde as shortly as they myght / & yt they shold not suffre Piers of Ganaston come agayn in to Englonde for to make his sone to ryot. And they graumted hym with a good wyll. Than ye kynge toke ye sacramentes of holy chirche as a good christen man shold / & dyed in very repen taumce whan he had regned .xxxv. yere / & was buryed at westmynster wt grete solempnite / on whose god haue mercy.  Of Merlyns prophecyes that were declared of kynge Edward that was kynge Henryes sone. OF this kyng Edwarde pphecyed Merlyn / and called hym a dragon the seconde of the. vs. kynges that sholde   tegne in Englonde / & sayd yt he sholde be medled with mercy & also wt strengthe & sternes / that shold kepe Englonde from colde & hete. And that he sholde open his mouth toward Wales / & that he sholde set his fote in Wyke / & that he shold close with walles yt shold do moche harme to his sede. And he sayd sothe / for the good kynge Edward was medled wt mercy & with fyersnes / with mercy agaynst his enemyes of Wales / & after of Scotlo¯de with fyersnes wham he put them to deth for theyr falsnes & traytory / as they had deserued it. And well kepte he Englond from colde & hete / syth he kepte it from all maner of enemyes that came vpon him to do hym ony wronge. And well he opened his mouth towarde Wales / & made it quake through ye hidour of his mouth whan he conquered it through dynt of swerde. For ye prynce Lewlyn & Dauyd his broder / Rys & Morgan were put to deth through theyr falsnes & theyr foly. And he set his fote in wike / & conquered Barwyke / at the whiche conquest were slayn .xxv. M. and. vij .C. out take them that were brent in the reed hall. And the walles that he let make shall be noyous vnto his sede / as men shall here after se in the lyfe of syr Edward of Carnaruan his sone. And yet sayd Merlyn that he sholde make ryuers ren in blode & with brayn / & that semed well in his warres where as he had the maystry. And yet Merlin sayd yt there shold come a people out of the north west durynge the regne of the foresayd dragon / yt sholde be ladde by an yll greyhoumde / yt the dragon sholde crowne kyng / that afterward sholde flee ouer ye see for drede of ye dragon without comynge agayn / & yt was proued by syr Iohn Bayloll ye kyng Edward made to be kynge of Scotlonde / that falsly arose agaynst him / & after he fled to his owne londes of Fraumce / & neuer came agayne in to Scotlonde for drede of kynge Edward. And yet sayd Meriyn the people that sholde lede the foresayd greyhoumde shold be faderles vnto a certayn tyme / & he sayd sothe / for ye people of Scotlonde gretely were dyseased / syth yt syr Iohn Bayloll theyr kung was fledde. And yet layd Merlin yt the sonne shold become in his tyme as reed as blode / in tokenynge of grete mortalite of people / & that was well knowe¯ whan ye scottes were  ay . And Merlyn sayd yt same dragon sholde nourysshe a foxe that sholde meue grete warre agaynst hym yt shold in his tyme be ended / & that semed well by Robert ye Brus that kyng Edward noursshed in his chambre / that sythen stale aware & meued grete warre agaynst hym wh  the warre was not ended in his tyme. And afterward Merlyn tolde yt this dra gon shold be holden ye best body of all the worlde / & he sayd sothe for ye good kyng Edward was ye worthyest knyght of all ye worlde in his tyme. And yet said mer lyn yt the dragon sholde dye in ye marche of an other londe / & yt his londe sholde be longe wtout a good keper / & yt men sholde wepe for his deth from ye yle of Shepey vnto ye yle of Mercill: wherfore alas shal be theyr songe amonge ye  myn people faderles in ye londe wasted. And ye p h  cy was knowen ouer all full well. For ye good king Edward dyed at Burgh vpom sandes / yt is in the marche of Scotlonde wherfore ye englysshmen were disco¯f ed & sorowed in Northumberiend bycause ye king Edwardes sone set by ye Scottes no force for ye tyot of Pyers of Ganaston wherfore alas was ye song through out all Englonde for defaute of theyr good wardeyn / from ye yle of Shepey vnto ye yle of Mareyll ye people made moche sorowe for good king Edwardes deth. For they wende yt kyng Edward shold haue gone in to the holy lond / for yt was holly   his purpose. Vpon whose soule god for his hygh grace haue mercy.  Anno d i. M .CC. lxxxiii . CElestinus was pope after Nicolas .v. monethes / and no thynge noble of hym is wryten / but yt he was a vertuous man.  Bonifacius the. vii . was pope after hy¯ .viij. yere. This Boniface was a man in those thynges that apperteyneth to courte / for he was very e pert in suche maters. And bycause he had no pere / he put no mesure to his prudence / & toke so grete pryde vpon hym / yt he sayd he was lord of all ye worlde. And many thy¯ges he dyd wt his myght that fayled wretchedly in the ende. He gaue an ensample to all prelates yt they  shold  not be proude / but vnder the forme of a very shepeherde of god they sholde more study to be loued of theyr subiectes than to be drad. This man is he of whome it is sayd yt he entred as a fox / he lyued as a lyon / & dyed as a dogge.  This tyme the yere of grace was ordeyned from an C. yere to an .C. yere / & the fyrst Jubile was in ye yere of our lord god. M .CCC.  Benedict{us} the .xj. was pope after Boniface .xi. monethes. This man was an holy man of ye ordre of ye frere prechours & lytell whyle lyued / but decessed anone.  Adulphus was Emperour .vj. yere. This man was ye erle of Anoxone / and was not crowned by ye pope / for he was slayne in batayle.  Albertus was emperour after hy¯ .x. yere.

And to that Albert ye same pope gaue the kyngdom of fraumce / as he dyd other kyngdomes / but it {pro}fyted not / for at the last he was slayne of his neuewe.  Clemens was pope after Benedictus almoost .ix. yere. This man was a grete buylder of castels & other thynges. And he dampned ye ordre of Templers. And he ordeyned the .vij. boke of decretalles the whiche be called y• questyons of Clementyns. And anone after in a coumseyle the whiche he helde at Vienna he reuoked that same boke / the whiche his successour Iohn called agayn / & incorpored it & publysshed it. This Clement fyrst of al popes translated the popes seet from Rome to Aumyon. And whyder it was done by the mocyon of god / or by ye boldnes of man / dyuerse men meruaylleth.  Iohn the .xxij. was pope after hym xviij. yere. This man was all gloryous as for those thy¯ges that were to be vsed through the actyfe lyfe. And he publysshed the Constytucyons of the Clementynes / & sent them to all ye vniuersitees. And many sayntes he canonysed. And ye fatte bysshopryches he deuyded. And he ordeyned many thynges agaynst ye plu ralite of benefices / and many heretykes he dampned / but whyder he was saued or not / our lorde god wolde not shewe to those that he loued very well.  Henry the .vij. was emperour after Albert .v. yere. This Henry was a noble man in warre / and he coueyted to haue peas by londe & water. He was a gloryous man in batayle / & was neuer ouercome with enemyes. And at the last he was poysoned of a frere whan that he houseled hym by receyuynge of the sacrament.  Of kynge Edwarde that was kynge Edwardes sone. ANd after this kynge Edwarde regned Edwarde his sone / that was borne at Carnaruan. And this Edward went in to Fraumce & there he spoused Isabell ye kynges doughter of Fraumce the .xxv. daye of Ianuary at ye chirche of our lady at Boloyn in the yere of our lorde Iesu Chryst a. M .CCC .vij. And   the .xx. daye of Feueryer the nexte yere y• came after he was crowned solemply at Westmynster of ye archebysshop of Caumterbury & of ye archebisshop of winchelse And there was so grete prees of people yt syr Iohn Bakwel was deed & murdred And anone as the good kynge Edward was deed / syr Edward his sone kyng of Englonde sent after Pyers of Ganaston into Gascoyn / & so moche he loued him yt he called him broder. And anone after he gaue hym ye lordshyp of Walyngford / & after yt he gaue him ye erledom of Cornewayle agaynst all ye lordes wyll of Englonde. And than brought he syr Walter of Langton bysshop of Chestre to ye tour of London in prison wt two knaues al onely to serue hym. For ye kyng was wroth wt hy¯ / bycause yt syr Walter made co¯playnt on hy¯ to his fader / wherfore he was put in prison in ye tyme of Troile baston. And the fore said Piers of Ganaston made so grete maystryes yt he went in to ye kynges tresoury in ye abbey of westmynster & toke y• table of golde wt the trestyls of ye same / & many other ryche iewels yt somtyme were kyng Arthurs / & toke them to a marchaumt yt was called Aymery of  and / for he  shold  bere them ouersee in to Gascoyne / & so he went thens & neuer came agayn after / whiche was a grete losse to this londe. And whan this Pyers was so rychely auaumced / he beca me wonders proude / wherfore al ye grete lordes of ye realme had hy¯ in despyte for his grete berynge / wherfore syr Henry La y   of Nichol / and syr Guy erle of wa  / the whiche good lordes ye good king Edward syr Edwardes fader king of Englonde charged y• Pyers of Ganaston sholde not come in to Englond for to brynge his sone Edward in to ryot. And all y• lordes of Englonde assembled them on a certayn daye at y•  eres prechours at London / & there they spake of ye dishonour that kynge Edward dyd to his realme & to his crowne. And so they assented all bothe erles & barons & all the comyns yt the foresaid Pyers of Ganaston sholde be exiled out of Englonde for euer more. And so it was done: for he forswore Englond & went in to Irlonde / & there ye kyng made hym chefetayn & gouernour of the londe by his commyssion. And there this Pyers was chefetayn of all ye londe and dyd there all that hym lyked & had power to do what he wolde. And yt tyme were ye temple s exiled through all th  stendom / bycause ye men put vpon them that they  shold  do thynges agaynst the fayth & good byl . Kynge Edward loued Piers of Ganaston so moche that he myght not forbere his company and so moche ye kyng gaue & behyght ye people of Englonde that ye er lyng of ye foresayd Pyers sholde be reuoked at  Stamford  through them yt had e led hym. Wherfore Pyers of Ganaston came agayne in to Englonde. And whan he was come  agayn in to this lond / he despysed ye gretest lordes of this londe / & called syr  bert of Clare erle of Glocester   and the erle of Nycholl syr Henry La y b rstenbely / & syr Guy erle of warwyk the blacke houmde of Arderne and also be called ye noble erle Thomas of Lancastre churle / & many other scornes & shames them sayd / & many other grete lordes of Englonde  wherfore they were toward hym full angry & wro  a d tyght  ore anoyed. And in ye same tyme dyed ye erle of Nycholl / but he charged or yt he dyed Thomas erle of La¯castre that was his sone  e that he sholde maynteyne his quarell agaynst this same Pyers of Ganaston vpon his blessynge. And so it befel through helpe of the erle Thomas of Lancastre & also of ye erle of Warwyk that the foresayd Pyers was heded at Gauersythe besyde Warwyk / the .xix.   daye of Iune / in the yere of grace a. M .ccc .xij. Wherfore the kynge was sore anoyed / & prayed god yt he myght se ye day to be auenged vpon ye deth of ye foresayd Pyers. And so it befell afterward as ye shall here. Alas the tyme / for ye foresayd erle of Lancastre & many other grete ba rons were put to pyteous deth & marty red bycause of the foresayd quarell. The kynge was than at London and helde a parliament / & ordeyned the lawes of syr Symond Mounford / wherfore the erle of Lancastre & the other erles & all ye clergye of Englonde made made an othe through counseyle of Robert of Wynchelse for to maynteyn tho ordinaumces for euermore.  How Robert the Brus came agayn in to Scotlonde / & gadred a grete power of men for to warre vpon kynge Edward. ANd whan syr Robert the Brus that made hy¯ kyng of Scotlond that before was fledde in to Norway for drede of deth of ye good kyng Edward / & also he herd of the debate yt than was in Englonde bytwene ye kynge & his lordes he ordeyned an hoost & came in to Englonde in to Northumberlond / & clene destroyed ye coumtree. And whan kyng Edward herde these tydynges he let assemble his hoost & mette ye Scottes at Estre uelyn on the daye of ye Natiuite of saynt Iohn Baptyst / in the thyrde yere of his regne / & in the yere of grace .M.ccc.xiiij. Alas ye sorowe & losse yt there was done. For there was slayne the noble erle Gylbert of Clare / syr Robert Clifford baron & there kyng Edward was discomfited / & Edmond of Maule the kynges steward for drede went & drowned hymselfe in a fresshe ryuer yt is called Bannokesborne Wherfore they sayd in reprofe of kynge Edward for as moche as he loued to go by water / & also for he was discomfyted at Bannokesborne / therfore ye maydens made a songe therof in ye coumtree of kyng Edwarde / & in this maner they songe.    Maidens of englond sore may ye morne for ty t haue lost your lemmans at Bannokesborne /  wt heuelogh /  what weneth the kyng of Englo¯d to haue goten Scotlonde wt rombilogh.    Whan kyng Edward was discomfited wonders fast he fled with his folke yt were lefte alyue / & went to Barwyk / & there helde hy¯. And after he toke hostages / yt is to saye / two chyldren of ye rychest of the towne / & the kyng went to London / & toke coumseyle of thy¯ges yt were nedefull vnto ye realme of Englonde.  In this tyme it befell that than was in Englonde a rybaud yt was called Iohn Tanner / & he said yt he was the good kyng Edwardes sone / & let call hym Edward of Carnaruan / & therfore he was taken at Oxford / & there he chalenged the frere Carmes chirche ye kyng Edwarde had gyuen them / the whiche chirche somtyme was the kynges hall. And afterward was this Iohn ladde to Northamton / & drawen & hanged for his falsnes / & or that he was deed he confessed & said before al those that were there that the deuyll behyght hym yt he  shold  be kynge of Englonde / and that he had serued the deuyll thre yere.  How the towne of Barwyk was taken through treason / & how two cardynals were robbed in Englonde. ON mydlent sondaye in the yere of our  lord  Iesu Chryst. M .ccc .xvj. Barwyk was lost through fals treason of one Pyers of Spaldyng / the whiche Pyers kynge Edwarde had put there for to kepe the same towne with many burgeyses of the same towne. Wherfore the chyldren that were put in hostage through the burgeyses of Barwyk folowed ye kynges marchalse many dayes fettred in stronge yrens.  And after   that tyme there came two cardynals in to  Englond  / whiche ye pope had sent for to make peas bytwene Englond & Scotlonde. And as they went towarde Durham for to haue sacred mayster Lowys of Beaumont bysshop of Durham / they were taken and  obbed vpon the more of Wynglesoown. Of whiche robbery syr Gylbert of Middelton was atteynt and taken / & drawen & hanged at London / & his heed smytten of & put vpon a spere / and set vpon newe gate / and the foure quarters sent to foure citees of Englo¯de And that same tyme befell many myscheues in Englond / for the poore people dyed for hunger / and so moche & so fast dyed that vnneth men myght them bury. For a quarter of whete was worth xl. shyllynges / and two yere & an halfe a quarter of whete was worth .x. marke. And often tymes the poore people stale chyldren and ete them / & ete also all the houmdes that they myght take / and also horses and cattes. And after there fell a grete moreyn amonge beestes in diuers countrees of Englonde durynge kynge Edwardes lyfe tyme.  How the Scottes robbed Northumberlonde. ANd in the same tyme came the Scottes agayne in to  Englond  and destroyed Northumberlonde / and brent & robbed that lond / and slewe men & women / & chyldren that laye in theyr cradels / & brent also chirches & destroied chrystendom / and toke & bare Englysshe mennes goodes as they had be¯ sarasyns or paynyms / & of the wyckednes yt they dyd all chrystendom spake of it.  How the Scottes wolde not amende theyr trespace / and therfore Scotlonde was enterdyted. ANd wham pope Iohn the .xxij. after saynt Peter herde of ye grete sorow & myschefe yt the scottes wrought he was wonders sory that christendom was so destroyed through the Scottes / and namely yt they destroyed so chirches wherfore ye pope sent a generall sentence vnder his bulles of leed vnto the archebysshop of Caunterbury & to the archebysshop of yorke / that yf Robert ye Brus of Scotlonde wolde not be iustifyed and make amendes vnto ye kyng of Englo¯de Edward theyr  lord  / & make amendes of his harmes yt they had done / & also to restore the goodes yt they had taken of holy chirche / that ye sentence sholde be pronounced through out all Englonde. And whan ye Scottes herde this / they  wold  not leue theyr malyce for the popes commaumdement / wherfore Robert the Brus Iames Douglas / & Thomas Randulf erle of Moref / & all those that wt them comoned or holpe them in worde or dede were accursed in euery chirche through out all Englonde euery day at masse .iii. tymes / & no masse shold be songe in holy chirche through out all Scotlonde but yf ye Scottes wolde make restitucyon of the harmes yt they had made vnto holy chirche / wherfore many a good preest & holy men therfore were slayne through the realme of Scotlonde / bycause they wolde not synge masse agaynst ye popes commaumdement & agaynst his wyll and to do and fulfyll the tyrauntes wyll.  How syr Hugh Spensers sone was made the kynges chamberlayne / and of the batayle of Mitone. ANd it was not longe afterward that ye kynge ne ordeyued a parliament at yorke / & there was syr Hugh Spensers sone made chamberlain. And the meane tyme whyle the warre lasted   the kyng went agayn in to Scotlonde yt it was wonder to wyte / & besyeged the towne of Barwyk / but ye Scottes went ouer ye water of Solewath yt was thre myle from ye kynges hoost / & pryuely they stale away by nyght & came in to englo¯d & robbed & destroyed all yt they myght / & spared no maner thy¯ge tyll yt they came to yorke. And whan ye englysshmen that were lefte at home herd these tydynges all tho yt might trauayle as well mo¯kes preestes / freres / thanons & seculers came & mette wt the scottes at Miton vpswale the .xij. day of October. Alas ye sorow / for the englisshe husbondmen that coude no thy¯ge of warre there were slayne & drow ned in an arme of ye see. And ye chefetaynes syr William of Melton archebisshop of yorke: & ye abbot of selby wt theyr stedes fled & came to yorke / & yt was theyr owne foly yt they had yt mischaumce / for they pas sed ye water of swale / & ye scottes set a fyre the stackes of hey: & ye smoke therof was so huge yt the englysshmen myght not se the scottes. And whan ye Englysshmen were gone ouer ye water / than came the Scottes wt theyr wynge in maner of a shelde & came towarde ye englysshmen in araye / & the englysshmen fledde / for vnneth they had ony men of armes / for the kyng had them almoost lost at ye syege of Barwyk / and the scottes hoblers went bytwene the brydge & the englysshmen. And whan ye grete hoost them mette / the englysshmen fled bytwene ye hoblers & ye grete hoost / & the Englysshmen almoost were there slayn / & they yt might go ouer the water were saued / but many were drowned. Alas for there were slayne many men of relygyon / seculers / preestes & clerkes: & wt moche sorow ye archebisshop escaped: & therfore ye Scottes called that batayle the whyte batayle.  How kynge Edwarde dyd all maner thynge that syr Hugh Spenser wolde. ANd whan kyng Edward herde these tydynges / he remeued his syege from Barwik & came agayn in to Englonde. But syr Hugh Spenser the sone that was ye kynges chamberlayne kepte so the kynges chambre / yt no man myght speke with ye kynge. But he had made with hym a f ette for to do all his nede / & yt ouer mesure. And this Hugh bare hym so stoute / that all men had of hym scorne and despyte. And the kynge hymselfe wold not be gouerned ne ruled by no maner man but onely by his fader and by hym. And yf ony knyght of Englonde had wodes / maners or lo¯des / that they wolde coueyte / anone ye kyng must gyue it them / or els the man that ought it sholde be falsly endyted of forfayte or felouy. And through suche doynge they disheryted many a bacheler / & so moche loude he gate that it was grete wonder. And whan ye lordes of Englonde sawe ye grete couetyse & the falsnes of syr Hugh Spenser the fader & syr Hugh the sone / they came to ye gentyll erle of Lancastre and asked hym of coumseyle of the dysease that was in ye realme through syr Hugh Spenser and his sone. And in haste by one assent they made a preuy assemble at Shyrburne in Elmede / and they made there an othe for to breke & dystrouble ye doynge bytwene ye king & syr Hugh spen ser & his sone vpom theyr power. And they went in to ye marche of wales & destroyed the londe of the foresayd syr Hughes.  How syr Hugh Spenser & his fader were exiled out of Englonde. WHan kyng Edward sawe ye grete harme & destruccyon that the barons of Englond dyd to syr Hugh Spen sers londe & to his sones in euery place yt they came vpon / the king than through his coumseyle exiled syr Iohn Mombray /    syr Roger Clifford / & syr Gosselin Dauil & many other lordes yt were consentynge to them / wherfore the barons dyd than more harme than they dyd before. And whan ye kyng sawe ye the barons wolde not cease of theyr cruelte / the kyng was sore adrad lest they wold destroye hym & his realme for his mayntenaumce / but yf he assented to them / & so he sent for them by lettres yt they sholde come to London to his parliament at a certayne daye as in his lettres were conteyned. And they came wt thre batayles well armed at all poyntes / and euery batayle had cote armures of grene cloth / & therof the ryght quarter was yelowe wt whyte bendes / wherfore that parliament was called ye parlyament of the whyte bende. And in that company was syr Vmfrey of Bohoune erle of Herford / & syr Roger Clifford / syr Iohn Mombray / syr Gosselyn Dauyll / syr Roger Mortimer of Wygmore / syr Henry of Trais / syr Iohn Gif fard / & syr Barthilme we of Badelsmore that was the kynges steward / that the kyng had sent to Shyrbur ein Elmede to ye erle of Lancastre / & to all that were with hym for to treate of accorde / yt hym alyed to the barons / & came wt that company. And syr Roger Dammorie / & syr Hugh Dandale ye had spoused ye kynges neces syster / & syr Gylbert of Clare erle of Glocestre yt was slayne in Scotlonde as before is sayd. And those two lordes had than two partyes of the erledome of Glocestre / & syr Hugh Spenser the sone had ye thyrde parte in his wyues halfe the thyrd syster / & those two lordes went to ye barons wt all theyr power agaynst syr Hugh theyr broder   lawe / & so there came with them syr Roger Clifford / syr Iohn Mombray / syr Gosselyn Dauyll / syr Roger Mortymer of Wygmore his neuew / syr Henry Trais / syr Iohn Giffard / syr Barthylmewe of Badelsmore with all theyr company & many other y• to them were consentyng. All the grete lordes came to Westmynster to the kynges parliament / & so they spake & dyd ye bothe syr Hugh Spenser the fader & also the sone were outlawed of Englonde for euermore. And so syr Hugh the fader went to Douer & made moche sorow / & fell downe vpon y• groumde by ye see banke acrosse with his armes / & sore wepyng sayd. Now fayre Englonde & good Eng londe to almyghty god I the betake / & thryes kyssed ye groumde / & wende neuer to haue comen agayn / & wepyng cursed the tyme yt euer he begate syr Hugh his sone / & sayd for hy¯ he had lost all englo¯de & in presence of all gaue him his curse & went ouer the see to his londes. But   Hugh the sone wolde not go out of Englonde / but helde hym on ye see & he & his company robbed two Dromondes besyde Sandwyche / & toke & bare awaye all ye was in them / the value of .xl. M. pounde.  How the kyng exiled ye erle Thomas of Lancastre / & all that helde with hym and how Mortimer came & yelded hym to the kynge / and of the lordes. IT was not longe after ye the kyng ne made syr Hugh Spenser th   a der & syr Hugh the sone come agayne in to Englonde agaynst the lordes wyll of the realme. And soone after the kyng wt a stronge power came and besyeged the castell of Ledes / & in the castell was the lady of Badelsmore bycause ye she wold not graumte that castell to the quene I sabell kyng Edwardes wyfe. But ye princypall cause was bycause ye syr Barthilmewe was agaynst the kyng & helde wt the lordes of Englonde / & neuerthelesse the kynge by helpe and socour of men of London / and also of helpe of southeren men gate the castell maugre of them all   that were within / & toke with them all that they myght fynde. And whan the barons of Englonde herde these tydynges / syr Roger Mor mer & many other lordes toke the towne of Burgworth wt strength / wherfore the kyng was wonders wrothe / & let outlawe Thomas of La¯castre / & Vmfrey de Bohoune erle of Herford / & all those that were assentyng to the same quarell. And the kyng assembled an huge hoost / & came agaynst the lordes of Englonde / wherfore the Mortimers put them in the kynges mercy & grace. And anone they were sente to the toure of London / & there kepte in prison. And whan ye barons herde this thynge they came to Poumtfret castell / where as the erle Thomas soiourned / & told hym how that ye Mortimers both had yelded them to ye kyng / & put them i his grace.  Of the syege of Tykhyll. WHan Thomas erle of Lancastre herd this / he was wonders wroth and all yt were of his company / & gretly they were discomforted / & ordeyned theyr power togyder / & besyeged the castell of Tykhyll. But those that were within manly defended them / that the barons coude not gete the castell. And whan the kynge herde yt his castell was besyeged he swore by god & by his names / that ye syege sholde be remeued / & assembled an huge power of people and went thyderward to rescowe the castell / & his power encreased from daye to daye. Whan the erle of Lancastre / & the erle of Herford / & the barons of theyr company herde of this thynge / they assembled all theyr power & went to Burton vpon Trent & kepte ye brydge yt the kyng sholde not passe ouer. But it befell so on the .x. daye of Marche in the yere of grace. M .ccc .xxj. the kyng & the Spensers / syr Aymer of Valaumce erle of Penbroke / & Ioh erle of Arumdell and theyr power we t ouer the water & discom yted the erle Thomas & his com pany. And they fled to the castell of Tutbery / & from thens to Poumtfret. And in ye vyage dyed syr Roget Danmore in the abbey of Tuthery. And that same tyme the erle Thomas had a traytour wt him that was called Robert Holand a knight that ye erle had brought vp of nought / & had nourysshed hym in his buttry / and had gyuen hym a. M. marke of londe by yere / & so moche the erle loued hym yt he myght do in ye erles courte all yt hym lyked wt hye & lowe / & so craftely the thefe bare hym / yt his lorde trusted hym more than ony man on lyue. And the erle had ordeyned hym by his lettres for to go in to the erledom of La¯castre to make men aryse to helpe hym in yt viage / that is to saye .v .C. men of armes. But the false traytour came not there no maner men for to warne ne reyse to helpe his lorde. And whan the fals traytour herde tell yt his lord was discomfited at Burton vpon Trent / as a fals traytour thefe stale awaye & robbed in Rauensdele his lordes men yt came from the disco¯fyture / & toke of them hors & harneys & all yt they had & slewe of them al that he myght take / & came & yelded hym to the kynge. Whan the good erle Thomas wyst yt he was so betrayed / he was sore abasshed / & sayd to hy¯selfe. O almighty god how myght Robert Holand fynde in his herte me to betraye / syth I loued hym so moche. O god well may now a man se by hy¯ / yt no man may deceyue an other rather than he that he trusteth moost vpon / he hath full euyll yelded me ye goodnes & ye worshyp yt I haue done to hym / & through my kyndnes haue auaumced him & made hym hye where that he was lowe / and he maketh me go from hygh vnto lowe / but yet shall he dye an euyll deth.  Of the discomfyture of Burbrygge. He good erle syr Thomas of Lancastre / Vmfrey de Bohoune erle of Herford / & the barons that were with them toke coumseyle bytwene them at the freres prechours in Poumfret / Thomas of Lancastre than thought vpon ye treason of Robert Holand / & sayd in reprefe. Alas Robert Holand hath me betrayed / aye is the reed of some euyll shreed. And by the comyn assent they  shold  go to the castell of Dunstanburgh / ye whiche apperteined to the erledom of Lancastre / & that they shold abyde there tyll that the kyng had forgyuen them his maletale¯t. But whan the good erle Thomas herde this / he answered in this maner & sayd. Lordes said he / yf we go toward ye north the northeren men wyll saye that we go towarde the Scottes / and so we shall be holden traytours / for cause of distaumce yt is bytwene kyng Edward & Robert the Brus that made him kyng of Scotlond & therfore I saye as touchynge my selfe I wyll not go no ferther in to the north than to myn owne castell of Pountfret. And whan syr Roger Clifford herd this he arose vp anone in wrath & drewe his swerde on hygh / & swore by almyghty god & by his holy names / but yf that he wolde go wt them / he shold there slee hy¯. The noble & gentyll erle Thomas was sore adrad & sayd. Fayre syrs I wyll go with you whether so euer ye me bydde. Than went they togider in to ye north / & with them they had. vij .C. men of armes / & came to Burbrygge. Whan syr Andrewe of Herkela yt was in the north coumtree through ordynaumce of the kynge for to kepe ye coumtree of Scotlonde herde tell how ye Thomas of Lancastre was dyscomfyted & his company at Burton vpon Trent / he ordeyned hym a stronge power / & syr Symond Ward also / that than was shyref of yorke / and me te the barons at Burbrygge / and anone they brake ye brydge that was made of tree. And whan ye erle Thomas of Lancastre herde that syr Andrewe of Herk a had brought wt hym suche a power / he was sore adrad / and sente for syr Andrewe of Herkela / and with hym spake / & sayd to hym in this maner. Syr Andrewe sayd he / ye may well vnderstande how yt out lorde the kynge is ladde and mysgouerned by moche false coumsey e through syr Hugh Spenser the fader and syr Hugh his sone / & syr Iohn erle of Arundell / & through mayster Robert Baldok a false pylled clerke / that now is dwellyng in ye kynges courte. Wherfore I praye you that ye wyll come with vs with all the power that ye haue ordeyned & helpe to destroye ye venym of Englonde, and the traytours that ben therin / and we wyll gyue vnto you all ye best parte of .v.  domes that we haue & holde / & we wyll make vnto you an othe yt we wyll neuer do thynge without your counseyle / & so ye shall be eft as well wt vs as euer was Robert Holand. Than answered syr Andrewe of Herkela & sayd. Syr Thomas that wold I not do no consent therto for no maner thy¯ge ye myght me gyue wtout the wyll & commaumdement of our lord the kynge / for than sholde I be holden a traytour for euermore. And whan yt the noble erle Thomas of Lancastre sawe yt he wolde not consent to hym for no maner thynge / he sayd. Syr Andrew wyll ye not consent to destroye ye ve  of the realme as we be / consent at one worde / syr Andrewe I tell the that or this yere be passed that ye shall be taken & holden for a traytour / and more than ony of you holde vs now / & of a worse deth ye shall dye than euer dyd knyght in Englo¯de / & vndersta¯de well yt ye dyd neuer thynge yt sorer shal repent you / & now go & do what   you good lyketh / & I wyll put me in to the mercy of god. And so wente the fals traytour tyraumt and as a fals forsworne man. For through ye noble erle Thomas of Lancastre he receyued the armes of chyualry / & of hym was made knyght. Than myght men searchers drawe the¯ on that one syde & on yt other / & knightes also / & than fought togyder wonders sore And also amonge all other syr Humfrey de Boughon erle of Herforde a worthy knyght of renome through all chrystendom stode & fought with his enemyes vpon the brydge / & as ye noble lorde stode & fought vpon ye brydge / a thefe rybaud skulked vnder the brydge & fyersly with a spere smote the noble knyght in to the foumdament / so ye his bowelles fell about his feet. Alas for sorowe / for there was slayne the floure of solace & comforte & also of curteysy. And syr Roger of Clifford a noble knyght stode euer & fought / & well & worthely hym defended / but at ye last he was sore wounded in his heed / & syr Willyam of S llay & syr Roger of Bernefelde were slayue at yt batayle. Whan syr Andrewe of Herkela sawe yt syr Thomas men of Lancastre lessed & slaked / anone he & his company came vnto ye gentyll  ayght / & sayd vnto hym wt an hye voyce. Yelde the traitour yelde the. The gentyll erle Thomas than answered & sayd. Nay lordes / traitours be we none & to you we wyll vs neuer yelde whyle that our lyues lasteth / but rather wyll we dye  our treuth than yelde vs vnto you. And syr Andrewe agayne behelde syr Thomas & his company yellynge & cryenge as a wood wolfe & sayd. Yelde you traytours taken yelde you / sayenge with an hye voyce / beware syrs yt none of you be so hardy vpon lyfe & ly   e to mis o Thomas body of Lancastre. And with that worde the good erle Thomas went into the cha e  and sayd k elyng vpon his knees / and turned his vysage towarde the crosse and sayd. Almyghty god vnto the I yelde me / & holly I put me vnto thy mercy. And with that the vylayns & rybaudes lepte aboute hym on euery syde as tyrauntes & wood turmentours / and despoyled hym of his ar mure / and clothed hym in a robe of raye that was of his squyers lyuerey / & forth ladde hym vnto Yorke by water. Than myght men se moche sorowe & care. For the gentyll knyghtes fled on euery syde and ye rybaudes & vylayns egerly them descryed / and cryed on hygh / yelde you traytours yelde you. And whan they were yolden / they were robbed & boumde as theues. Alas the shame and despyte that ye gentyll ordre of knyghthode had there at that batayle. And the lond was than without lawe / for holy chirche had than no more reuerence than yf it had ben a brodell hous. And in that batayle was the fader against the sone / and the vncle agaynst the neuewe. For so moche vnkyndnes there was neuer seen before in Englonde as was that tyme amonge folkes of one nacyon. For one kynrede had no more  yte on that other / than an ho gry wolfe hath of a shepe, & it was no wonder. For the grete lordes of Englonde were not all borne of o   a yon / but were  edled with other na s / that is for to saye / some were Brytons some Sa o s / some  nes / some Pehytes / some Fren  / some Normans / Spanya des / Romayns / Heno ers /   F em ges / with m y other  oyons the whiche nacyons ac ed not to the kynde blode of Englond. And yf so gret  lordes ha  be¯ onely  dded  o  nglysshe people / than sholde rest and pe s haue ben a ge them without o y en y. And at ye batayle were taken prysoners syr Roger E ord / syr Iohn M bray syr Wyllyam Tuchit / syr Willyam  itz   Willyam / & many other worthy knygh tes there were taken at that batayle. And syr Hugh Dandell the nexte daye after was taken & put in to prison / and sholde haue be¯ done to deth yf he had not spoused the kynges nece that was erle Gylbertes syster of Glocestre. And anone after was syr Barth mew of Badelsmere taken at Stowe parke / a manoyr of the bysshop of Lyncolnes / that was his neuewe / & many other barons & baronets wherfore was made moche sorowe.  How syr Thomas of Lancastre was byheded at Pountfret / and .v. barons & a knyght drawen & hanged there. NOw I shall tell you of the noble erle syr Thomas of Lancastre. Whan he was taken & brought to yorke many of the cyte were full glad / & vpon hym cryed with an hygh voyce. O syr traytour ye be welcome / blyssed be god / for now ye shall haue the rewarde that longe tyme ye haue deserued. And cast vpon hym many snowe balles / & many other reproues they dyd hym. But the gentyll erle suffred all and sayd not one worde agayne. And at ye same tyme the kynge herde of this disco¯fyture / & was full glad / and in haste came to Poumtfret and syr Hugh Spenser & syr Hugh his sone / & syr Iohn erle of Arundel / and syr Edmond of wodstok the kynges broder erle of Kent / syr Aymer of Valaumce erle of Penbroke / & mayster Robert Baldok a fals pylled clerke / that was preuy and dwelled in the kynges courte / & all came thyder with the kynge. And the kynge entred in to the castell. And syr Andrewe of Herkela a fals tyraumt through ye kynges commaundement toke with hym the gentyll erle Thomas to Pountfret / and there he was prysoned in his owne castell that he had newe made / that stode agaynst the abbey of kynge Edwarde. And syr Hugh Spenser the fader & his sone cast in theyr thoughtes how and in what maner the good erle Thomas of Lancastre  shold  be put to deth without ony iudgement of his peres. Wherfore it was ordeyned through ye kynges Iustices that the kynge  shold  put vpon hym poyntes of treason. And so it befell that he was ledde to barre before the kynges Iustices bare heded as a thefe in a fayre hall in his own castell where as he had made many a grete feest to riche & poore. And these were his Iustices syr Hugh Spenser the fader / & Aymer of  a a e erle of Penbroke / syr Edmond of wodstok erle of Kent / syr Iohn of Brytayn erle of Rychmond / & syr Robert Mal m  Iustice / & this syr Robert him acou ped in this maner. Thomas at the first our lorde ye kyng & this courte excludeth y u of all maner answere. Thomas our l d the kyng putteth vpon you yt ye haue   his lo¯d ryden wt baner displayed against his peas as a traytour. And with that worde yt gentyll erle Thomas wt an   voyce sayd. Nay lordes forsoth & by  a  Thomas I was neuer traytour. The Iustyce sayd agayn. Thomas our  lord  the kyng putteth vpom you yt ye haue robbed his folke & murdred his people as a thefe. Thomas also ye kyng putteth   you yt he disco¯fyted you & your people wt his folke in his owne realme wherfore ye went &  ed to ye wode as an  . And Thomas as a traitour ye ought to be hanged by reason but the kyng hath forgyuen you that Iudgement for  ue of quene Isabell. And Thomas reason wolde that ye sholde be hanged but the kynge hath forgyuen you yt  udgement for loue of your lygnage. But Thomas for as moche as ye were taken fleynge & as an ou lawe ye kyng wyll yt your heed be smytten of as ye haue well deserued   Anoue haue hym out of pr es & brynge hym to his iudgement. Whan ye gentyll knyght Thomas had herd al these wor des / with an hye voyce he cryed sore wepyng & sayd. Alas saint Thomas fayre fader / alas shall I be deed thus. Graumt me now blissedfull god answere. But all auayled hym  o thynge. For the cursed Gascoyns put hym hyder & thyder / & on hym cryed wt an hye voyce. O kyng Arthur moost terryble and dredefull / well knowen is now thyn open traytory / an euyll deth shalt thou anone dye / as thou hast well deserued it. And than they set vpon his heed in scorne an olde chapelet that was all to rent that was not worth an halfpeny. And after that they set hy¯ vpon a l ne whyte palfrey full vnsemely / & also all bare / & with an olde brydell and with an horryble noyse they droue hym out of the castell toward his deth / and they cast vpon hym many balles of snowe in despyte. And as the traytours ladde hym out of the castel he sayd these pyteous wordes / holdynge vp his handes towarde heuen. Now the kynge of heuen gyue vs mercy / for ye erthly kyng hath vs forsaken. And a frere prechour went with hym out of the castell tyll he came to the place that he ended his lyfe / vnto whom he shroue hy¯ of all his lyfe. And the gentyll erle helde the frere wonders fast by the clothes & sayd to hym. Fayre fader abyde with vs tyll that I be deed / for my flesshe quaketh for drede of deth. And the sothe to saye / the gentyl erle set hym vpon his knees and turned hym towarde ye eest. But a rybaud that was called Higone of Moston set hande vpon the gentyl erle / & sayd in despyte of hym. Syr traytour turne the toward ye Scottes thy foule dethe to receyue / and turned hym toward the north. The noble erle Thomas answered than with a mylde voyce & sayd. Now fayre lordes I shall do your wyll. And with ye worde the frere went from hym sore wepynge And anone a rybaud wente to hym and smote of his heed the .xi.  Kal.  of Apryll / in the yere of grace. M .CCC. and .xxi. Alas yt euer suche a gentyll blode sholde be put to deth wtout cause & reason. And traytoursly was the kynge counseyled whan he through the fals coumseyle of ye Spensers suffred syr Thomas his vncles sone to be put to suche a deth & so by heded agaynst all reason. And grete pite it was also yt suche a noble kynge sholde be deceyued and mysgouerned through coumseyle of ye fals Spensers the whiche he maynteyned through loselry against his honour & also {pro}fyte. For afterwarde there fell grete vengeaumce in Englonde bycause of the foresayd Thomas dethe.  Whan the gentyll erle of his lyf was passed / the pryour & ye monkes of Poumtfret gate the body of syr Thomas of the kyng / and they buryed it before the hye awter on ye ryght syde. That same daye that this ge¯tyl knyght was deed / there were hanged & drawen for ye same quarell at Poumtfret / syr Wyllyam Tuchet / syr William fitz William / syr Warreyn of ysell / syr Henry of Bradborne / and syr Wyllyam Chayny / barons all / & Iohn Page squyer. And soone after at Yorke were drawen & hanged sir Roger Clifford syr Iohn of Mambray barons / & syr Goselyn Dauyll knyght. And at Brystowe were drawen and hanged / syr Henry of wemyngton / and syr Henry Mounford barons. And at Glocestre were drawen and hanged syr Iohn  Geffard  / and syr Willyam of Elmebrugge barons. And at London were drawen & hanged / syr Henry Tyes baron. And at Wynchelse syr Thomas Colepeper knyght. And at Wyndsore was drawen and hanged syr Fraumceys of waldenham baron. And at Caumterbury was drawen & hanged syr   Barthylmewe Badelsmore / & syr Barthylmewe of Asshebourneham barons / And at Cardyfe in Wales syr Willyam Flemmynge baron.  How kyng Edward went in to Scotlonde with an hondred thousande men of armes / and myght not spede. ANd wham kyng Edward of Englonde had brought the floure of chyualry vnto theyr deth through coun seyle & consent of syr Hugh Spenser the fader / and syr Hugh the sone / he became as wood as ony lyon. And what so euer the Spensers wolde haue / it was done / so well the kynge loued them that they myght do wt hym all thynge yt them lyked / wherfore ye kyng gaue to syr Hugh Spenser the fader the erledom of Wynchestre / & to syr Andrewe of Herkela the erledom of Cardoyll in preiudyce and in harmynge of his crowne. And kyng Edward than through coumseyle of ye Spensers disheryted all them that had ben agaynst hy¯ in ony quarell wt Thomas of Lancastre / & many other were disheryted also / bycause yt the Spensers coueyted to haue theyr lo¯des / & so they had all that they wolde desyre with wronge & agaynst all reason. Than made ye kyng Robert Baldok a fals pylled clerke chaum celer of Englonde / through coumseyle of ye foresayd Spensers / & he was a fals rybaude and a couetous. And so they coumseyled the kyng moche that the kyng let take to his own warde all ye goodes of ye lordes yt were put wrongfully to deth in to his own ha¯des. And as well they toke the goodes yt were wtin holy chirche as ye goodes yt were wtout / & let them be put in to his tresoury in London / & let them call his forfeytes. And by theyr coumseyle the kyng wrought / for euermore he disheryted them yt ought the goodes. And through theyr coumse le let arere a tallage of all ye goodes of Englond / wherfore he was ye richest kyg ye euer was in englo¯d after Willyam bas ard of Norman y ye conquered Englonde. And yet through counseyle of them hy semed ye he had not ynough / but made yet euery towne of Englonde for to fynde a man of armes vpon theyr own costes / for to go & warre vpon the Scottes yt were his enemyes / wherfore ye kyng went in to scotlonde wt an .C. M. men of armes at whitsontyde in ye yere of our lord. M .CCC .xxij. But the scottes went & hyd them in wodes & in mountaynes & taryed ye englysshmen fro day to day / yt the kyng myght for no maner thy¯ge fynde them in playn    wherfore many englisshmen ye had   vytayles dyed there for honger wonders fast / & sod ynly in goynge & comynge & namely those that had ben against Thomas of La¯castre & robbed his men vpon his lo¯des. Whan kyng Edward sawe yt vytayles fayled hym / he was wonders sore dyscomforted / bycause also yt his men dyed: & for he might not spede of his enemyes. So at ye last he came aga  to Englo¯de. And anone after came Iames douglas & also Thomas   huge hoost into Northumberlonde & wt them ye englysshmen yt were dryuen out of Englonde / & came & robbed ye   & slewe the people & also br nt a  owne that was called Northall  & many other townes to Yorke. And whan the kyng herde these tydynges he let  m n all maner of men that myght trauayle. And so the Englysshmen mette y• Scottes at the abbey of  eyghlonde the .xv. daye after Myghelmasse in y• sam  yere aboue sayd and the Englysshmen were discomfyted. And at that dyscomfytu  was taken syr Iohn of Brytayn erle of Rychemond that helde the coumtre  and the erledome of Lancastre and after he   payed an huge raunsom and was let go And after that he went in to Fraunce / & came neuer afterwarde agayne.  How syr Andrewe of Herkela was taken & put to deth y• was erle of Cardoyll. THan at y• tyme was syr Andrew of Herkela that newe was made erle of Cardoyll / bycause y• he had taken the good erle Thomas of Lancastre. He had ordeyned through y• kynges commaum dement of Englonde for to brynge him all the power y• he myght for to helpe hy¯ agaynst y• Scottes at y• abbey of Beyghlonde. And whan the fals traytour had gadred all y• people y• he myght & sholde haue comen to y• king to y• abbey of Beighlond / the fals traytour ladde them by an other countree through Copelonde / and through y• erledom of Lancastre / & went through y• coumtree & robbed & slewe folke all y• he myght. And ferthermore y• fals traytour had taken a grete so¯me of gold & syluer of syr Iames Douglas for to be agaynst y• kyng of Englond / & to be helpyng & holdyng wt the scottes / through whose treason y• kyng of Englond was discomfyted at Beighlonde or y• he came thyder. Wherfore y• kynge was toward hym wonders wroth / & let pryuely enquyre by y• coumtre aboute how y• it was. And so men enquyred & espyed / that at y• last the trouth was foumde & sought / and he atteynt & taken as a fals traitour / as the good erle Thomas of La¯castre hym tolde / or that he was put to dethe at his takynge at Burbrydge / & to hym sayd / or that yere were done he shold be taken & holden a traytour. And so it was as y• holy man sayd. Wherfore the kyng sent priuely to syr Anthony of Lucy a knight of the coumtree of Cardoyll that he sholde take syr Andrewe of Herkela & put hym to deth. And to bryng this thynge to an ende / the kynge sente his commyssyon / so that this same Andrewe was taken at Cardoyll & ledde to the barre in y• maner of an erle worthely arayed / and with a swerde gyrde aboute hym / and boted & sporred. Than spake syr Anthony in this maner / syr Andrewe sayd he / the kynge putteth vpon the for as moche as y• hast benorped in thy dedes he dyd to the moche honour / & made the erle of Cardoyll & thou as a traytour to thy lorde laddest the people of his countree y• sholde haue holpe hym at y• batayle of Beighlond / & thou laddest them away by y• coumtree of Copelonde & through y• erledom of Lancastre / wherfore our lorde y• kynge was disco¯fyted there of the Scottes through thy treason & falsnes / & yf thou haddest comen betymes he had had the batayle / And treason y• dydest for y• grete somme of gold and syluer that thou receyued of Iames Douglas a Scotte the kynges enemy. And our lorde y• kyng wyll that the ordre of knyghthode by the whiche y• receyued all thyne honour and worship vpon thy body / be all brought to nought & thyne estate vndone / y• other knightes of lower degree may after be ware / the whiche  lord  hath hugely auaunced the in dyuers coumtrees of Englonde / & that all may take ensample by y• / theyr lorde afterward truly for to serue. Than commaumded he a knaue anoue to hewe of his sporres on his heles. And after he lette breke the swerde ouer his heed / the whiche the kyng gaue hym for to kepe & defende his londe therwith whan he had made hym erle of Cardoyl. And after he let hy¯ be vnclothed of his furred tabard and of his hode / & of his furred cotes / & of his gyrdell. And wham this was done syr Anthony sayd than to hym. Andrew sayd he / now arte thou no knyght / but a knaue / and for thy treason the kynge wyll that y• shalte be hanged & drawen /    and thy heed smytten of / & thy bowelles taken out of thy body & brent before the & thy body quartred / & thy heed sente to London / & there it shall stande vpon London brydge / & the foure quarters shal be sente to foure townes of Englonde / that all other may be ware & chastised by the And as syr Anthony said / so it was done all maner thynge on y• last daye of October / in the yere of grace. M .CCC .xxij. And y• sonne turned in to blode as y• people it sawe / & that dured from y• morowe tyll it was .xj. of the clocke of the daye.  Of y• myracles that god wrought for saynt Thomas of Lancastre / wherfore the kynge let close in the chirche dores of the pryory of Pountfret / that no man sholde come therin for to offre. ANd soone after that y• good erle Thomas of La¯castre was martyred / there was a preest that lo¯ge tyme had ben blynde / dremed in his slepe y• he sholde go to y• hyll there y• good erle Thomas of Lancastre was put to deth / & he sholde haue his syght agayn / & so he dremed thre nyghtes suynge / & y• preest let lede him to y• same hyll / & whan he came to the place y• he was martyred on / full deuoutly he made there his prayers / & prayed god & say¯t Thomas y• he myght haue his syght agayne / & as he was in his prayers / he layde his ryght hande vpon y• same place y• the good man was martyred on / and a drop of drye blode & small sande cleued on his hande / & therwith stryked his eyen / & anone through the myght of god and saint Thomas he had his syght agayne / & thanked than almyghty god & saynt Thomas.  And wham this myracle was knowen amo¯ge men / y• people came thyder on euery syde and kneled & made theyr prayers at his tombe that is in y• pryory of Poumtfret / & prayed y• holy martyr of socour & helpe / & god herde theyr prayers.  Also there was a yonge childe drowned in a welle in y• towne of Poumtfret / & was deed thre dayes & thre nyghtes / and men came & layde y• deed chilo  vpon saynt Thomas tombe y• holy martyr / & the chylde arose from deth to lyfe / as many a man it sawe.  Also moche people were out of theyr mynde / & god sent them theyr mynde agayn / through vertue of y• holy martyr.  Also god hath gyuen there to exepyls theyr goynge / & to croked theyr handes & theyr feet / & to blynde also theyr fyght and to many seke folke theyr helth of byuers dyseases / for y• loue of this martyr.  Also there was a ryche man in Co  dom in Gascoyn / and suche a malady he had that all his ryght syde ro ed & fell away from hym y• men might se his  uer & his herte / & so he stanke y• vnneth men myght come nye hy¯ / wherfore his frendes were for hym wonders sory / but at the last as god wold they prayd to saynt Thomas of Lancastre y• he  wold  praye to god for that prisoner / & behyght to go to Poumtfret for to do theyr pylgrymage he thought y• the martyr sam  Thomas came to him & anou ted ouer all his seke body / & therwith the good man aweke & was all hole / & his flesshe was restored agayn y• before was torred & fallen away For whiche myracle the good man & his frendes loued god & saint Thomas euer more after. And this good man came in to Englonde / & toke with hym foure selowes and came to Poumtfret to the holy martyr / & dyd theyr pylgrymage / & the good man that was seke came thyder al naked / saue his preuy clothes. And wham they had done / they turned home agayn in to theyr owne roumtree / and tolde of the myracle where so euer that they came.  And also two men haue be¯ heled there of the mormale / through helpe of y• holy   martyr / though that euyll be holden incurable.  And whan y• Spensers herd that god dyd suche myracles for this holy man / they wold not byleue it in no maner wyse / but said openly y• it was grete heresy suche vertue of hy¯ to byleue. And whan syr Hugh Spenser the sone sawe all this doynge / anone he sente his messenger from Poumtfret where as he dweled to kyng Edward / that than was at Grauen at Scipton / bycause y• the kyng sholde vndo y• pylgrymage. And as y• ry baud messenger went to ward the kyng for to do his message / he came by the hyll where as the good martyr was done to deth / & in the same place he made his ordure / & wham he had done he rode toward the king / & a stronge flyxe came vpon hy¯ or that he came to Yorke / & than he shedde all his bowels at his foundament. And whan syr Hugh Spenser herde these ty dynges / somdele he was adradde / and thought for to vndo y• pilgrymage yf he myght by ony maner waye. And anone he went to the kyng & sayd y• they  shold  be in grete sclaumdre through out all chry stendom for the deth of Thomas of Lancastre / yf that he suffred the people to don theyr pylgrymage at Pountfret / & so he coumseyled y• kyng y• he commaumded to close the chirche dores of Poumtfret / in y• whiche y• holy martyr was buryed / & thus they dyd agaynst all fraumchyses of holy chirche / so y• foure yere after myght no pylgrym come to y• holy body / & bycause that the monkes suffred men to come & honour y• holy body of saynt Thomas y• martyr / through counseyle of syr Hugh Spenser the sone / & through coumseyle of mayster Robert Baldok the false pylled clerke the kynges chaunceler / the kyng consented that they sholde be set to theyr wages: & let make wardeyns ouer theyr own good longe tyme / & through commaum dement of y• foresayd syr Hugh Spenser xiiij. gascoyns well armed kept the hyll where as the good man saynt Thomas was done to dethe / so that no pylgrym might come by y• waye. Full well wend he to haue taken Chrystes myght & his power & the grete boos of myracles that he shewed for his martyr say¯t Thomas through all christendom. And that same tyme the king made Robert Baldok the fals pylled clerke through prayer of syr Hugh Spensers sone chaumceler of Englonde. And in y• same tyme was y• castell of Walyngford holden agaynst y• kynge through y• prysoners that were wtin the castell for saynt Thomas quarell of Lancastre. Wherfore the people of y• coumtree came & toke the castell vpon y• prisoners. Wherfore syr John Goldington knight & syr Edmond of Beche prisoners / and a squyer yt was Roger of Walton were taken & sent to y• kyng to Poumtfret / & there they were put in prison / & y• foresayd Roger was sent to yorke / and there he was drawen & hanged. And anone after syr Roger Mortimer of wigmore brake out of the Toure of London in this maner. The foresayd Roger herde yt he  shold  be drawen & hanged at London on the morowe after saynt Laurence daye / & on y• daye before he helde a fayre feest in the toure of London / & there was syr Stephen Segraue constable of y• toure & many grete men wt them / & wham they  shold  soupe / y• foresayd Stephen sent for all y• officers of y• toure / & they came & souped with hym / & wham they shold take theyr leue of hy¯ / a squyer yt hyght Stephen yt was full preuy with the foresaid Roger through his coumseyle gaue them suche a dry¯ke y• the lest of them al slept .ij. days & ij. nyghtes / & in the meane tyme he escaped away by y• ryuer of Tamys / & went ouer y• see & helde hym in Fraumce. Wherfore the king was sore anoyed / & put the same Stephen out of his Constablery.  How quene. Isabell went in to Fraumce for to treate of peas bytwene her lorde the kynge of Englonde and the kynge of Fraunce her broder. THe kynge went than to London and there through coumseyle of syr Hugh Spenser the fader & of his sone & of mayster Robert Baldok a fals pylled clerke his chaunceler / let sease than all the quenes londes in to his handes / and also all the londes y• were syr Edwardes his sone / & were so put to theyr wages agaynst all maner of reason / & that was through y• falsnes of the Spensers. And whan the kyng of Fraumce yt was quene Isabelles broder herde of this falsnes / he was sore anoyed agaynst y• kynge of Englonde & his fals coumseylers. Wherfore he sent a lettre to kyng Edward vnder his seale / yt he shold come in to Fraumce at a certayn day for to do his homage & therto he somoned hym / & els he shold lese all Gascoyn.  And so it was ordeyned in Englond through the kyng & his coumseyle that quene Isabell sholde go in to Fraumce for to treate of peas bytwene her lorde & her broder. And that Olyuer of yngham sholde go in to Gascoyn / and haue with hym .vij. M. men of armes & more / to be senesshall & wardeyn of Gascoyn. And so it was ordeyned that quene Isabell went in to Fraunce / & with her went syr Aymer of Valaumce erle of Pen broke / that was there murdred sodeynly in a preuy syege / but yt was through goddes vengeaumce / for he was one of the Iustyces y• consented to saynt Thomas deth of Lancastre / & wolde neuer after tepent him of that wycked dede. And at that tyme syr Olyuer of yngham went ouer in to Gascoyn / & dyd moche harme to the kyng of Fraumce / and than he gate agayne that kynge Edwarde had lost / and moche more therto.  How kynge Edwarde sent syr Edward his sone the eldest in to Fraumce. THe quene Isabell had but a quarter of a yere dwelled in Fraunce whan syr Edward her eldest sone as d leue for to go in to Fraumce for to speke wt his moder Isabell y• quene. And his fader y• kyng graumted hym wt a good wyll & sayd to hy¯ / go my fayre sone in goddes blessyng & myne / & thynke for to come agayn as hastely as ye may. And he went ouer see in to Fraumce / & y• kyng of Fraumce his vncle receyued hy¯ wt moche honour & sayd to him. Fayre sone ye be welcome & for bycause yt your fader came nor to do his homage for y• duchy of Guy nne as his auncesters were wont to do  I gyue you y• lordship to hold it of me in herytege as all maner auncestres dyd before you wherfore he was called duke of Guyen.  How the kyng exiled his quene Isabell and Edwarde his eldest sone. WHan kyng Edward of Englonde herde tell how y• kynge of Fraumce had gyuen y• duchy of Guyen to syr Edward his sone / wtout consent & wyll of hy¯ & that his sone had receyued y• duchy   became wonders wroth: & sent to his sone by lettre & to his wyfe also y• they  sh ld  come agayn in to Englonde in all haste. And the quene Isabel & syr Edward her sone were wonders sore adrad of y• kynges menaces & of his wrath / & pryncypally for y• falsnes of y• Spensers / bothe of the fader & also of the sone & at his commaumdement they wold not come. Wherfore kyng Edward was full sore anoyed & let make a crye at London / that yf the quene Isabell & Edward his eldest sone came not in to Englonde yt they  shold  be holden as enemyes / bothe to ye realme & also to the crowne of Englond. And for yt they wolde not come in to Englond / but   bothe were exiled the moder & her sone. Whan ye quene herd these tydynges / she was sore adrad to be destroyed through the fals coniectynge of the Spensers / & went wt the knyghtes yt were exiled out of Englonde for saynt Thomas cause of Lancastre / that is to saye / syr Roger of wigmore / syr William Trussell / syr Iohn of Tromwell / & many other good knightes / wherfore they toke theyr coumseyle & ordeyned amo¯ge them for to make a maryage bytwene ye duke of Guyen ye kynges sone of Englonde & ye erles doughter of Henaud / yt was a noble knyght of name & a doughty in his tyme / & yf yt thynge myght be brought about / than stode they trowynge wt ye helpe of god & wt his helpe to recouer theyr herytage in Englo¯de / wherof they were put out through the fals coniectynge of the Spensers.  How kynge Edward through counseyle of the Spensers sente to the douze pers of Fraunce that they sholde helpe that the quene Isabell & her sone syr Edward were exiled out of Fraunce. WHan kynge Edward & the Spensers herde how yt quene Isabell & syr Edward her sone had alyed them to the erle of Henaud / & to them that were exiled out of Englonde for cause of Thomas of La¯castre / they were so sory that they wyst not what to do. Wherfore syr Hugh Spenser ye sone sayd to syr Hugh his fader in this maner wyse. Fader cursed be ye tyme & the coumseyle that euer ye consented that quene Isabell shold go in to Fraumce for to treate of accord bytwene the kynge of Englonde & her broder the kyng of Fraumce / for that was your coumseyle / for at yt tyme forsothe your wytte fayled / for I drede me sore leest through her & her sone we shall be destroyed / but yf we take the better coumseyle.  Now fayre syrs vndersta¯de how meruaylous felony & falshede the Spensers ymagyned & cast. For pryuely they let fyll .v. barels ferrours wt siluer / the somme amounted to .v. M. pounde / & they sent those barels ouer see pryuely by an alyen yt was called Arnolde of Spayne / that was a broker of London / that he sholde go to ye douzepers of Fraunce / that they sholde procure & speke to the kynge of Fraunce that quene Isabell & her sone Edwarde were dryuen & exiled out of Fraumce / and amo¯ge all other thy¯ges that they were brought to the deth as pryuely as they myght. But almyghty god  wold  not so For wham this Arnold was in ye hygh see he was taken with Selanders yt mette hym in the hygh see / & toke hym & ladde hym to the erle of Henaud theyr lorde / & moche ioye was made for that takyng. And at the last this Arnold pryuely stale away fro thens & came to London. And of this takyng and of other thynges the erle of Henaud sayd to the quene Isabell Dame make you mery & be of good chere / for ye be richer than ye wend to haue  n / & take these .v. barels full of siluer yt were sente to the douzepers of Fraunce for to slee you and your sone Edward / & thynke hastely for to go in to Englonde / & take ye with you syr Iohn of Henaud my broder and .v .C. men of armes / for many of them of Fraunce in whome ye haue had grete trust / do but scorne you. And almyghty god graunte you grace your enemyes to ouercome. Than sent the quene Isabell through Henaud and Flaumdres for her soudyours / and ordeyned her euery daye for to goo in to Englonde agayne. And so she had in her company syr Edmonde of Woodstocke / that was erle of Kent / and was also syr Edwardes broder of Englonde.  How kyng Edward let kepe ye costes   by the see / & let trye all the pryce men of armes & fote men through Englonde. Nd whan kyng Edward herde tell that quene Isabel & Edward her sone wolde come in to Englond with a grete power of alyens / and with them that were outlawed out of Englonde for theyr rebellyousnes / he was sore adrad to be put downe / and for to lese his kyngdome / wherfore he ordeyned to kepe his castels in Wales as well as in Englond with vytayles & theyr apparayle / & let kepe his riuers & also ye see costes / wher of the .v. portes toke to kepe them & also the see. And at the feest of Decollacion of saynt Iohn baptist / the citezyns of London sent to the king to Porchestre an .C. men of armes. And also he commaumded by his lettres ordeyned / yt euery hondred & wepentake of Englonde / to trye as well men of armes as men on fote / & that they sholde be put in .xx. somme / & in an hondred somme / & commaumded yt al those men were redy whan ony oyes or crye were made / for to pursue & take ye alyens that came in to Englonde for to take the londe from hym & put hy¯ out of his kyngdom And more ouer he let crye through his patent in euery feyre & in euery market of Englond / yt the quene Isabel & syr Edward his eldest sone & the erle of Kent / yt they were taken & safely kepte wout ony maner of harme vnto them doynge / & al other maner people yt came with them anone smyte of theyr hedes without ony maner of raumsom takynge of them. And what man might bry¯ge syr Roger Mortimers heed of wygmore / shold haue an C. pounde of money for his trauayle. And ferthermore he ordeyned by his patent & commanuded to make a fyre vpon euery hyll / besyde ye ryuers & in lowe coumtrees for to make hye bekens of tymbre / that yf it so were that the alyens came to the loude by nyght / that men sholde kyndle the bekens / that the countree myght be warned & come & mete theyr enemyes. And in that tyme dyed syr Roger Mortimer his vncle in the  ou e of London.  How the quene Isabell & syr Edward duke of Guyenne her so e came to londe at Herewich / and how they dyd. Nd whan quene Isabel and syr Edward her sone duke of Guyenne / syr Edmonde of Wodstocke erle of Kent / and syr Iohn the  ri s   of Henaud and theyr company d adde   the threteuynges of kynge Edward   of his traytours / for they trusted a  goddes grace / and came vnto   in Suffolke the. xxii j. daye of September / & in the yere of our lord Iesu Christ M .CCC. xxv . And the quene &   Edward her sone sent lettres to the May  and comynalte of London / r ge them that they wolde be helpyng in the quarell and cause that they had beg  that is to saye / to destroye the  ray ou s of the realme. But none answere was sent agayne / wherfore ye quene & syr Edward her sone sent another pa    vnder theyr seales / the   of wh che lettre here foloweth in this maner.  Isabell by the grace of god quene of Englonde / lady of Irlonde & coumcesse of Pountyf / & we Edward the eldest sone of the kynge of Englonde duke of Guyenne / erle of Chestre / of Pounty  and of Moustroyll / to the Mayre and  o all the comynalce of the cite of London sendeth gretynge. For as moche as we haue before this tyme sent to you by our lettres how we be come in to  his londe in good araye & in good maner / for the honour & {pro}fyte of holy chirche & of our ryght dere lorde ye kynge & all ye realme with all our myght to kepe & maynteyn / as we   all   the good folke of the foresayd realme are holden to do. And vpon yt we praye you that ye wyll be helpyng to vs in as moche as ye may in this quarell that is for the comyn profyce of ye foresayd realme. And we haue had to this  yme none answere to the foresayd lettres / ne knowe not your mynde in that party.

Vnderstande ye well that yf ye do this our prayer & commaundement / we wyll the more be holden vn to you. And also ye shall gete you worshyp and pryfyte yf ye sende vs hastely answere of all your wyll agayn at Baldok / the syxth daye of October. Whiche lettre erly in the dawnynge of the day of saynt Denys was tacked vpon ye newe crosse in chepe / & many copyes of ye same lettre were tacked vpon windowes and dores and vpon other places in the cite of London / yt all men passyng by the waye myght them se & rede. And in the same tyme kyng Edward was at London in the toure at his meet / and a messenger came in to the hall & sayd that the quene Isabell was comen to londe at Herewich & hath brought in her company syr Iohn of Henaude / & with hym men of armes without nombre. And with that worde syr Hugh Spenser ye fader spake & thus sayd vnto ye kynge. My moost worshypfull lorde & kyng of Englond / now make we good chere / for certaynly they ben all ours. The kynge herde this worde comfortable / yet was he full sorowfull & pen syfe in his herte. And the kynge had not fully eten / but there came in to ye hall an other messenger / & sayd yt the quene Isabell was arryued at Herewich besyde Ipswyche in Suffolk. Syr Hugh spenser the fader spake to ye messenger & said Tell soth in good fayth my fayre frende is she comen wt a grete strength. Now certes syr the soth for to saye / she ne hath in her company but .vij. hondred men of armes. And with yt worde syr Hugh spenser the fader cryed with an hygh voyce and sayd. Alas alas we ben al betrayed for certes wt so lytel power she had neuer comen to londe but yf ye folke of this londe were vnto her consentyng. And therfore after meet they toke theyr counseyle and went towarde Wales for to arere ye Walshmen agaynst the quene Isabell & Edward her sone / all for to fyght / and so they were in purpose euerychone.  How mayster Walter Stapylton bisshop of Excestre ye was the kynges tresourer was heded at London. Nd in the same tyme kyng Edward was sore adrad lest yt men of London wolde yelde them to ye quene Isabel & to her sone Edward. Wherfore he set mayster Walter Stapylton his tresourer for to be wardeyn & keper of ye cite of London wt the Mayre / & so came to the  ylde hall of London / & asked the keyes of the gates of the Cyte / through   vertue and strength of his commyssyon / & wolde haue had ye kepyng of ye cite. And the comuners answered and sayd that they wolde kepe the cite to the honour of kynge Edwarde & of Isabell the quene and of the duke ye kynges sone wtout ony moo. Than was ye bysshop sore anoyed / and swore othes yt they all sholde abye it anone as kynge Edwarde were comen out of Wales. And all the comuners of the Cite anone toke the bysshop & ladde hym amyddes of the Chepe / and there they smote of his heed / & set his heed in his ryght hande. And after they heded two of his squyers that helde with the bysshop / & one of them was called Wyllyam of Wayle / that was the bysshops neuewe / & that other was called Iohn of Padington. And also they toke a burgeys of London that was called Iohn Marshall / that was syr Hugh spensers spye the fader / & smote of his heed also. In the same tyme yt bisshop had at London a fayre toure in makyng in his close vpon the ryuer of Tamys / yt was wtout temple barre / & stone fayled to make an ende therof / wherfore he commanded his men to go to the freres Carmes / & there they toke stone to make therwt the toure & moche sande & morter & olde robous yt was lefte. And for the despyte yt the bysshop had done vnto holy chirche: he & his two squyers were buryed in ye sande / as though they had ben houmdes / and there they laye .xj. wekes / tyll that the quene Isabell sent her lettres to the comuners & prayed them that they wolde suffre & graumt / that the bysshop myght be taken out of ye place & be buryed at Excestre in his own chirche / & so he was / & his two squyers were buryed at saint Clementes chirche wtout temple barre. And it was no wonder though that bysshop dyed an euyl deth / for he was a couetous man / & had wt hym no mercy / & euyll coumseylled the kynge. And soone after was Arnold of Spayne taken / that assented to haue ladde .v. M. pounde of syluer in .v. barels ferryers vnto ye douze ers of Fraumce / for to helpe & haste the quene Isabell to her deth / & Edward her sone also. And this Arnold was put to deth wtout the cite.  How kyng Edward & syr Hugh spenser & the erle of Arundell were taken. WHan kynge Edwarde had sente mayster Walter Stap lton his tresourer to London / for to kepe the cite vnto hym agaynst ye quene Isabell his wyfe / & agaynst Edwarde his sone / anone hymselfe toke with hym sir Hugh Spenser ye sene / and syr Iohn o  Arundell / & mayster Robert Ba dok his chaunceler a fals pylled prcest / and toke theyr waye toward Brystowe / & there ye kynge abode a lytell tyme / and made syr Hugh Spenser the fader as Constable & keper of ye castell. And ye ky¯g & that other spenser went to shyppe & sayled toward Wales / & toke no leue of ye steward n  of none of ye kynges houshold & w  euer in to Wales for to arere the W  agaynst dame Isabel the quene and the duke her sone / & the erle of Kent and syr Iohn of Henaud. And they went & pursued after the¯ / & theyr power encreased dayly. So at ye last the kyng was taken vpon an hyll in Wales & syr Hugh spenser ye sone on ye other syde of ye same  yll / & the false pylled clerke mayster Robert Baldok there fast besydes them / & they were brought agayn in to Englonde as almyghty god wolde. And ye kyng hym selfe was put in safe kepyng in ye castell of Kelynworth / & hym kepte syr Henry that was saynt Thomas broder of Lancastre. And syr Hugh ye fader came & put hym in the quenes grace & syr Edwarde her sone duke of Guy . But syr Hugh   Spenser after the tyme y• he was taken he wolde neyther ete nor drynke / for he wyst well he  shold  haue no mercy / saue onely to be deed. And the quene & her coum seyle had ordeyned that he sholde haue ben done to deth at London / but he was so feble for his moche fastynge y• he was nygh deed / & therfore it was ordeyned y• he shold haue his iudgement at Herford And at a place of y• toure his hode was taken from his heed / & also from Robert Bal dok yt fals pylled clerke & y• kynges chaum celer / & men set vpom theyr hedes chaplets of sharpe nettyls / & two squyers blewe in theyr eres wt two grete bugles hornes vpon the two prisouers / that one myght here theyr blowynge more than a myle. And one Symond of Redyng y• kynges marshall bare before them vpon a spere theyr armes reuersed: in token that they sholde be vndone for euermore. And on y• morowe was syr Hugh Spenser y• sone dampned to deth / & was drawen & hanged & heded / & his bowelles taken out of his body & brent / & after yt he was quartred / & his .iiij. quarters were sent to. iiij townes of Englonde / & his heed sente to London brydge. And this Symond for cause that he despysed quene Isabell he was drawen & hanged on a stage made amyddes y• foresaid syr Hughs galowes And y• same daye a lytell from thens was syr Iohn of Arundell byheded / bycause he was one of syr Hugh Spenses counseylers. And anone after was syr Hugh Spenser y• fader drawen & hanged & heded at Brystowe / & after hanged agayn by the armes wt two stronge ropes: & the fourth day after he was hewen all to pe ces / & houmdes ete hym. And bycause the kyng had gyuen hym y• erledom of wyn chestre his heed was put vpon a spere & sente thyder. And the fals Baldok was sent to London / & there he dyed in prison amo¯ge theues / for men dyd hy¯ no more reuerence than they wold do to a dogge. And so dyed y• traytours of Englo¯d blissed be god. And it was no wonder / for through theyr coumseyle y• good erle Tho mas of La¯castre was done to deth / & all that helde with Thomas of Lancastre through the traytours were vndone / & all theyr heyres disheryted.  How kyng Edward was put downe and his dignite taken from hym. ANd anone after as all this was done / quene Isabell & Edwarde her sone duke of Guyenne / & all the grete lordes of Englonde at one assent sente to kyng Edward to y• castell of Kenilworth where as he was in kepynge vnder the warde of syr Iohn Hachim that was y• bysihop of Ely / & of syr Iohn of Percy a baron / for bycause that he sholde ordeyn his parlyament at a certayne place in Englond / for to redresse and amende the estate of the realme. And kyng Edward them answered & sayd. Lordes sayd he ye se full well how it is / lo haue here my seale / and I gyue you all my power for to ordeyne a parlyament where that ye wyll. And than they toke theyr leue of hym & came agayn to y• barons of Englonde. And whan they had the kynges patent of this thynge / they shewed it to the lordes. And than was ordeyned that the parliament shold be at westmynster at the vtas of saynt Hylary. And all the grete lordes of Englonde let ordeyne for them there agaynst that tyme that the parlyament sholde be. At whiche daye that y• parlyament was / the kyng wolde not come there for no maner thynge as he had set hymselfe & assygned. And neuerthelesse the barons sent vnto hym one tyme & other. And he swore by goddes soule that he wolde not come there one fote. Wherfore it was ordeyned by all the grete Lordes of Englonde that   he sholde no longer be kyng / but be depo sed / & sayd they wolde crowne Edward his sone y• elder yt was duke of Guyenne And sent tydynges vnto the kyng there as he was in warde vnder syr Iohn erle of Garen / & syr Iohn of Bothun yt was bysshop of Ely / & syr Henry Percy a baron / & syr Willyam Trussell a knyght y• was with y• erle Thomas of Lancastre for to yeld vp theyr homages vnto hym for all them of Englonde. And syr Wyllyam Trussell sayd these wordes. Syr Edward / bycause that ye haue betrayed your people of Englond / & haue vndone many grete lordes or  Englond  without ony cause / ye shall be deposed / & now ye be withstande thanked be god. And also bycause that ye wold not come to y• parliament as ye ordeyned at Westmynster as in your owne lettre patent is conteyned / for to treate wt your lyege men as a kyng sholde. And therfore through all y• comyns assent & of all the lordes of Englonde I tell vnto you these wordes. Ye shall vnderstande syr that the barons of Englond at one assent wyll that ye be no more king of Englond / but vtterly haue put you out of your ryalte for euermore. And the bysshop of Ely than sayd to the kynge. Syr Edwarde here I yelde vp feaute & homage for all y• archebisshops & bysshops of Englond & for all y• clergy. Than sayd syr Iohn erle of Garen. Syr Edward I yelde vp here vnto you feau te and homage for me & for all y• erles of Englo¯de. And syr Henry Percy gaue vp also there his homage for him & for all y• barons of Englonde. And than sayd syr William Trussell. I yelde vp now vnto you syr myn homage for me & for all the knyghtes of Englonde / & for all them y• holde by sergeaumtry or by ony other maner thynge of you / so y• from this day af terward ye shall not be claymed kynge / nor for kynge be holden. But from this tyme afterwarde ye shall be holden for a singuler man of all y• people. And so they went thens to London / where y• lordes of Englonde abode them / & syr Edward abode in prison i good kepyng. And this was on the daye of y• co¯uersyon of saynt Paule / in the .xx. yere of his regne.  Of the prophery of Merlyn declared of kynge Edwarde the sone of kynge Edward the fyrst. OF this kyng Edward prophecyed Merlin & sayd y• there sholde come a gote out of Carre yt  shold  haue hornes of syluer / & a berde as whyte as snowe / and a droppe shold come out of his nosethrylles yt sholde betoken moche harme honger & dethe of people / & grece losse of his londe. And that in y• begynnynge of his regne sholde be haumted moche lechery. And he sayd sothe / alas the tyme for kyng Edward yt was kyng Edwardes sone was borne at Carnaruan in Wales For sothe he had hornes of syluer and a berd as whyte as snowe whan he was made pry¯ce of Wales / to moche he gaue hym to ryot and to foly. And sothe sayd Merlyn in his {pro}phecy / that there  shold  come out of his nose a droppe. For in his tyme was grete honger among y• poore people / & stronge dethe amonge y• ty the that dyed in strange londe with sorowe & in warre in Scotlond. And afterward he lost Scotlonde & Gascoyn & moche le chery in his dayes was haumced.  Also Merlyn sayd yt this gote sholde seke the floure of lyfe & of deth. And he sayd so the for he spoused Isabell y• kynges syster of Fraumce. And in this tyme Merlyn sayd that there shold be made brydges of folk vpon dyches of the see. And y• was well seen at Bannockesbourne in Scotlonde wham he was disco¯tyted there of y• Scotces. And Merlyn tolde also that stones   sholde fall from castels / & many townes shold be made playne. And he sayd sothe For whan kynge Edward was discomfyted in Scotlonde & came than southwarde / the Scottes besyeged castels & dyd moche harme / & brent townes vnto the harde erth.  And afterward Merlyn tolde that an egle sholde come out of Cornewayle that sholde haue fethers of golde / that of pryde sholde haue no pere / and he shold despyse lordes of blode / and after he shold dye through a bere at Gauersyche / & that prophecy was full well knowen & foumde soche. For by the egle is vnderstande syr Pyers Ganaston / that than was erle of Cornewayle / whiche was a wonders proude man / & despised the barons of Englonde / but afterward he was heded at Gauersyche through ye erle of Lancastre & the erle of warwyk.  And Merlyn tolde that in this tyme it sholde seme that the bere sholde brenne and that batayle shold be vpon an arme of the see in a felde arayed lyke a shelde where sholde dye many whyte hedes / & he sayd sothe. For by the brennynge of ye bere is betokened grete drede through cuttynge of swerdes at that batayle of Myton / for there came ye Scottes in maner of a shelde in a wynge / & slewe men of religyon / preestes and seculers / wher fore the Scottes called that batayle in despyte of Englysshmen the whyte batayle.  And after Merlin sayd that the foresayd Bere sholde do the Gote moche harme / & yt sholde be vpon ye south west / and also vpon his blode. And sayd also yt the Gote shold lese moche dele of his londe / tyll the tyme that shame sholde hym ouercome / & than he shold clothe hym in a lyons skynne / & sholde wynne agayne that he had lost / & more through people that sholde come out of the north west / yt sholde make hym to be fered and hym auenge vpon his enemyes through counseyle of two owles / that fyrst  shold  be in peryl to be vndone. And those two owles sholde go ouer see in to a straumge londe / & there dwell a certayn tyme / & after shold returne agayn in to Englond / & shold do moche harme to many one / & that they sholde coumseyle ye Gote to meue warre agaynst the foresaid bere / & the gote & the owles sholde come to an arme of ye see at Burton vpon Trent / & sholde go ouer / & that for drede the bere sholde flee with a swan in his company to Bury towarde ye north through an vnkynde outpulter / & that ye swan than shold be slayne wt sorow and the bere  shold  be slayne full nye his owne nest / yt shold stande vpon Poumtfret vpon whome the sonne sholde shede his bemes / & many folke shold seke hym for his vertue. And he sayd sothe. for ye good erle Thomas of La¯castre was borne in the north west / & cosyn to ye kynge & his vncles sone / & by lawe he made ye kynge lese moche lo¯de yt he had purchased wyl fully tyll at ye last the kynge toke therof shame / & hymselfe fylled wt cruelte. And after gate agayne yt he had lost & moche more / through helpe of folk comyng out of ye northwest / by whom he was drad / & auenged hy¯ on his barons through coumseyle of ye two Spensers yt afore were out lawed for theyr wickednes / & after came agayne out of Fraumce / & so moche these Spensers coumseyled ye kynge yt he  shold  warre vpon Thomas of Lancastre / so yt the kyng & the Spensers and the erle of Arundell and theyr power mette with Thomas of Lancastre at Burton vpon Trent / and hym there discomfyted / and syr Vmfrey erle of Herford was in his company. And after fledde the foresayd Thomas and Vmfrey with theyr company to Burbrygge / metynge with syr Andrewe of Herkela / that is called ye vnkynde outpulter / and also syr Symond Warde erle of Yorke they came & met wt   Thomas of La¯tastre wt an huge company / & them there disco¯syted / & in y• disco¯siture y• crle of Herford was slayne vpon the brydge cowardly with a spere in the foumdement / & the erle Thomas was taken & ladde to Poumtfret / & than was he heded besyde his owne castell. But afterward many hym sought for myracles y• god dyd for hym. And in y• tyme Merlyn sayd / for sorowe and harme sholde dye a people of his londe / wherfore many londes sholde be vpon hym the more bolder And he sayd sothe / for bycause of his barons that were put to deth for say¯t Thomas quarell of Lancastre / people of many londes became the bolder for to meue warre vpon theyr kyng / for theyr blode was turned to many nacyons. And afterward Merlyn tolde & sayd yt the foresayd owles sholde do moche harme vnto the floure of lyfe & deth / and they sholde brynge her to moche dysease / so that she sholde go ouer see in to Fraumce for to make peas to y• floure delyce / & there sholde abyde tyll on a tyme her sede shold come and seke her / and there they shold abyde bothe tyll y• tyme that they sholde clothe them with grace / & those two owles she sholde seke & put them to pyteous deth. And that prophecy was well knowen / & was full sothe. For syr Hugh Spenser the fader & syr Hugh the sone did moche sorowe and persecucyon vnto the quene Isabell through theyr {pro}curement to her lord y• kyng. So they ordeyned amonge them y• she was put vnto her wages / y• is to saye .xx. shillynges in y• daye / wher fore the kyng of Frauce her broder was sore alwyed / & sent in to Englonde by his lettres vnto kynge Edward y• he sholde come vnto his parlyament to Parys in Fraumce. But kynge Edwarde was sore adradde to come there / for he wende to haue be arested tyll that he had made amendes for the trespace that syr Hugh Spenser the fader & the sone had done / & for y• harme y• they had done to the quene Isabell his syster. Wherfore through her ordynaumce & consent of y• Spensers y• quene Isabell went ouer see in to Frauce for to make accorde bytwene kyng Edwarde & the kyng of Fraumce her broder. And there dwelled she in Fraumce tyll Edward her eldest sone came for to seke her and so they dwelled there bothe tyll that alyaumce was made bytwene them & the gentyl erle of Henaud / yt yf they wt theyr vertue myght destroye & ouercome y• ves nym & the falsnes of the Spensers that syr Edward sholde spouse dame Philip the worshypfull lady & the erles doughter of Henaud. Wherfore the quene Isabell & Edward her sone / & syr Edmonde of wodstocke the kynges broder of Englond / & syr Iohn of Henaud / & syr Rogrt Mortimer of Wygmore / & syr Thomas Rocelyn / & syr Iohn of Cromwell / & syr Willyam Trussell / & many other of the alyaunce of the gentyll erle Thomas of Lancastre yt were exiled out of Englo¯de for his quarel / & were disherued of theyr londes / ordeyned them a grete power & arryued at Herewich in Suffolke. And soone after they pursued the Spensers tyll yt they were taken & put to pytcous deth / as before is said / & theyr company also / for y• grete falsnes that they dyd to kynge Edward and to his people. And Merlyn sayd also more y• the gote sholde be put to grete disrase & grete anguysshe & in grete soro wehe sholde lede his lyfe. And he sayd sothe / for after y• tyme that kyng Edward was taken he was put in to warde tyll that y• Spensers were put to deth / & also bycause he wolde not come to his parlyament at London as he had ordeyued & assygned hymselfe vnto his haronage / & also wolde not gouerne and rule his people nor his realme as a kynge sholde do. Wherfore some of y• barons   of Englo¯de came & yelded vp theyr homages vnto hym for them and all the other of the realme on the daye of y• conuersyon of saynt Paule / in y• yere of his regne .xx. And they put hym out of his royalte for euermore / & euer he lyued afterward in moche sorowe & anguysshe. LVdouicus was emperour after Henry .iiij. yere. This Lodewik was duke of Bauare / & he despysed the crownacyon of y• pope / wherfore y• pope deposed him / and moche labour & many peryls he had after / & he troubled gretly the vnite of holy chirche. Than was chosen agaynst hym Frederyke duke of Austryche. And he ouercame the duke / & abode a rebellyon to his ende / & in grete peryll to his soule. And at the last Karolus was chosen agaynst hym / the whiche preuayled / & sodeynly Lodewyk fell down of his hors and decessed.  Iohn Maundeuyll a doctour of physyk and a knyght was borne in Englonde aboute this tyme. And he made a meruaylous pylgrymage / for he went almoost about all y• worlde / & he wrote his dedes in thre languages / & decessed & was buryed at saynt Albons.  Benedictus the .xxij. was pope after Iohn .vij. yere & more. This man was a monke / and in all his youth he was of good co¯uersacyon / and a doctour of diuinite. And wham he was made pope he reformed y• ordre of saynt Benet in that thynge y• was necessary. And he was an harde man to graunte benefyces / leest he had graunted it to an vnconnynge man. He made a decretall y• whiche began Benedictus de{us} in donis suis. And he was very cruell in his fayth And for y• of some men was lytell loued. He was so stoute a man that almoost he wolde not knowe his owne cosyns.  Anno dn¯i. M .CCC .xxvij.  Of kynge Edwarde the thyrde after the conquest. AFter this kyng Edward of Carnaruan regned syr Edwarde of Wyndsore his sone / y• whiche was crowned kynge & anoynted at Westmynster / through coumseyle & consent of all y• grete lordes of y• realme y• sondaye on Candelmasse euen / in y• yere of grace. M .CCC .xxvj. that was of age at y• tyme but .xv. yere. And for bycause y• his fader was inwarde in the castel of Kenilworth & also was put downe of his royalte / y• realme of Englonde was without kyng from y• feest of saint Katherin in the yere aboue sayd vnto the feest of Candelmasse. And than were all maner plees of y• kynges benche astent. And than was commaunded to all y• sheryues of Englo¯d through wrytte to warne y• partyes to defendaumtes through somnynge agayn. And also ferthermore y• al prisoners y• were in the ky¯ges gayles y• were attached through sheryues / shold be let go quyte.  Kyng Edwarde after his crownacyon at the prayer & besechynge of his lyege men of the realme graumted the¯ a chartre of stedfast peas to all them y• wold aske it. And syr Iohn of Henaud & his company toke theyr leue of the kyng & of y• lordes of the realme / & turned home to theyr own coumtre agayn / & eche of them had full ryche gyftes / euery man as he was of value & of estate. And than was Englond in rest & peas / & grete loue bytwene the kyng & his lordes. And comynly Englysshmen sayd amo¯ge them y• the deuyl was deed But the innumerable tresour of y• kyng his fader / & the tresour of the Spensers bothe of the fader & of y• sone / & of y• erle of Arundell / & of mayster Robert Baldoc y• was y• kynges chaumceler was departed after y• quene Isabelles ordynaumce & syr Roger Mortimers of wygmore / so that   the kynge had no thynge therof / but at her wyll & her delyueraumce / nor of theyr londes / as afterwarde ye shall here.  How kyng Edward went to Stanhope for to mete the Scottes. ANd yet in y• same tyme was the kyng in the castel of Kenilworth vnder y• kepynge of syr Henry that was erle Thomas broder of La¯castre y• than was erle of Leycestre / & the kyng graumted hym y• erledom of Lancastre / that y• kyng his fader had seased in to his ha¯des & put out Thomas of Lancastre his broder. And so was he erle of Lancastre & of Leycestre / & also steward of Englo¯de as his broder was in his tyme. But syr Edward that was kyng Edwardes fader made sorowe wtout ende / for bycause he myght not speke wt his wyfe nor wt his so¯ne / wherfore he was in moche mischefe For though it were so y• he was lad & ruled by fals coumseyle / yet was he king Edwardes sone called Edward wt the longe shankes / & came out of y• worthiest blode of all y• worlde / & they to whom he was wont to gyue grete gyftes & large / were moost preuy wt the kyng his sone / & they were his enemyes bothe by nyght & by daye y• {pro}cured to make debate & contake bytwene hym & his sone and Isabel his wyfe. But y• frere prechers were to him good frendes euermore / & cast bothe by nyght & by day how they myght brynge hym out of prison. And amonge theyr company y• the freres had pryuely brought there was a frere y• called Dunhened / & he had ordeyned & gadred a grete company of folke to kepe at y• nede / but y• frere was taken & put in y• castell of Poumfret / & there he dyed in pryson / & syr Henry erle of Lancastre that had y• kynges fader in kepyng through commaundement of the kynge delyuered Edward y• kynges fader by endenture to syr Thomas of Berkeley / & so syr Iohn Mautreuers & they led him from y• castel of Kenilworth to y• castell of Berkley / & kept hy¯ there safely And at cester next after his crownacyon the kynge ordeyned an huge hoost for to fyght agaynst y• Scottes. And syr Iohn the erles broder of Henaud came from beyonde y• see for to helpe kyng Edward / & brought wt hym. vij .C. men of armes / & arryued at Douer / & they had leue for to go forth tyl they came to yorke where as the king them abode / & y• Scottes came thyder to y• kynge for to make peas & accorde / but the accordement lasted not bytwene them but a lytell tyme. And at y• tyme the Englysshmen were clothed all in cotes & hodes peynted with   & with floures full semely wt lo¯ge berdes / & therfore the Scottes made a byll that was fastened vpon the chirche dores of saynt Peters towarde stengace / & thus sayd y• scripture in despyte of Englysshemen.  Longe berdes bertles / peynted hodes wytles / gaye cotes graceles / maketh Englonde thryftles. ON Trinite sondaye nexte after began the co¯take in the cite of Yorke bytwene the Englysshmen and the Henaudes / & in that debate were slayne of the erledom of Nycholl & murdred.  . men / & after they were buryed vnder a stone in saynt Clementes chirche in  gate. And bycause y• the Henaudes came to helpe the king / theyr peas was cryed vpon payne of lyfe & lymme & in y• other halfe it was foumde by an enquest of y• cite that the Englysshmen began y• debate.  How y• Englysshmen stopped y• Scottes in y• parke of Stanhope / & how they returned agayne into Scotlonde. ANd at y• tyme y• Scottes had assembled all theyr power & came in to Englo¯de & slewe & robbed all y• they myght take / & also brente & destroyed all   the north coumtree throughout tyll y• they came to the parke of Stanhope in wyre dale / & there y• Scottes helde them in a busshment. But whan y• kyng had herde through certayn spyes where y• scottes were / anone right wt his hoost besyeged them within y• foresayd parke / so that y• Scottes wyst not where to go out / but onely to theyr harmes / & they abode in y• parke .xv. days / & vytayles fayled them on euery syde / so y• they were gretly appayred of theyr bodyes. And syth y• Brute came fyrst in to Brytayn to this tyme there was neuer seen soo fayre an hoost what of Englysshmen & of alyens & of men on fote / the whiche ordeyned them for to fyght with the Scottes / through eggyng of syr Henry of La¯castre & of syr Iohn of Henaud y• wold haue gone ouer the water of wyth for to haue fought wt the Scottes. But syr Roger Mortymer consented not therto / for he had pryuely taken mede of the Scottes to helpe them that they myght go in to theyr countre. And this Mortimer coumseyled so moche Thomas of Brotherton y• erle Marshall that was kyng Edwardes vncle that y• foresaid Thomas sholde not assemble at that tyme vnto y• Scottes / & he assented but he wyst not the doynge bytwene the Scottes & the foresayd Mortimer. And bycause y• he was Marshall of Englo¯de & to hym perteyned euer y• vaumtwarde / he sent hastely to y• erle of Lancastre & to syr Iohn of Henaud that they  shold  not fyght with the Scottes / in preiudyce & harmyng of hym & his fee / & yf they did that they sholde stande to theyr owne peryll. And y• foresayd erle Marshall was al arayed wt his batayle at y• reredoos of the erle of La¯castre for to haue fought wt hym & wt his folke / yf he had meued for to fyght wt the Scottes. And in this maner he was deceyued / & wyst nothynge of the treason. And thus was the kyng principally deceyued. And whan it was nyght Mortymer that had the watche for to kepe of the hoost y• nyght / dystroubled y• watche that nothynge myght be done. And in y• meane whyle y• Scottes stole by nyght toward theyr owne countree as fast as they myght. And so was the kynge falsly betrayed / that wende y• all the traytours of his londe had ben brought to an ende as it was said before Now here ye lordes how traytoursly y• kyng Edward was deceyued / and how meruaylously & boldly the Scottes dyd of warre. For Iames Douglas wt two hondred men of armes rode throughout all the hoost of kyng Edward / the same nyght y• Scottes escaped toward theyr owne coumtre as is aboue sayd tyll y• they came to y• kynges pauylyon / and slewe there many men in theyr beddes / & cryed naward naward / & an other tyme a douglas a douglas. Wherfore y• kyng that was in his pauilyon & moche other folk were wonders sore afrayde. But blissed be god y• kyng was not taken / & in grete peryll was than y• realme of Englonde. And y• nyght the mone shone full clere & bryght. And for all the kynges men the Scottes escaped harmeles. And on the morowe whan the kyng wyst that the Scottes were escaped in to theyr owne coumtre / he was wonders sory / & full hertely wepte wt his yonge eyen / & yet wyst he not who had done hym y• treason / but that fals treason was full well knowen a good whyle after as the story telleth. Than kynge Edwarde came agayne to yorke full sorowfull / & his hoost departed / and euery man went in to his owne coumtree with full heuy chere and mournynge semblaunt / & the Henaudes toke theyr leue & went in to theyr owne countre / & the king for theyr trauayle hugely rewarded them. And for bycause of that vyage the kynge had dyspended moche   of his tresour & wasted.  And in that tyme were seen two mones in y• fyrmament / that one was clere and that other was derke / as men myght se through y• worlde. And a grete debate was y• same tyme agaynst pope Iohn the .xxij. after saynt Peter / & the emperour of Almayn tho made hym emperour agaynst y• popes wyll / y• tho helde his see at Auinyon Wherfore y• emperour made his crye at Rome & ordeyned an other pope y• hyght Nicholas y• was a frere Minour / & that was agaynst the ryght of holy chirche / wherfore he was cursed / & the power of that other pope soone was layd. And bycause y• suche meruayles were seen: men sayd y• the worlde was nygh at an ende.  Of the deth of kynge Edwarde of Carnaruan. ANd now go we agayn to syr Edward of Carnaruan y• was king Edwardes fader somtyme kyng of Englonde / & was put downe of his dignite. Alas for his tribulacion & sorowe y• hym befell through fals coumseyle y• he loued & trusted vpon to moche / that afterwarde were destroyed through theyr falsnesse as god wold. And this Edward of Carnaruan was in y• castell of Berkeley / vnder y• kepyng of syr Moryce of Berkeley and syr Iohn of Mautreuers / & to them he made his co¯playnt of his sorowe & of his disease. And ofte tymes asked of his wardeyns what he hadde trespaced agaynst dame Isabell his wyfe & syr Edward his sone y• was made newe kyng that they wold not visyte hym. And than answered one of his wardeyns & sayd. My worthy lorde dysplease you not y• I shall tell you / the cause is / for it is done them to vnderstande / y• yf my lady your wyfe come ony thynge nye you / that ye wolde her strangle & slee / & also that ye wolde do to my lorde your sone y• same. Than answered he with a symple chere Alas alas am not I in prison / and all at your owne wyll / now god it wote I neuer thought it / & now I wolde y• I were deed / so wolde to god y• I were / for than were all my sorowe passed. It was not longe after y• the kyng through coumseyle of Roger Mortymer graumted y• warde & kepynge of syr Edward his fader to syr Thomas Toiourney / & to y• foresayd syr Iohn Mautreuers through the kinges lettre / & put out holly y• foresayd syr Moryce of the warde of the kyng. And they toke & lad the kyng to y• castell of Corf  y• whiche castel y• kyng hated as ony deth. And they kept hym there tyll it came vn to saynt Mathewes day in September in the yere of grace. M .CCC .xxvii. that the foresayd syr Roger Mortimer sent y• maner of y• deth / how & in what wyse he shold be put to deth. And anone as y• foresayd Thomas & Iohn had seen y•   & commaumdement / they made kynge Edwarde of Carnaruan good chere & good solace as they might at y• souper / and no thynge the kyng wyst of y• treason. And whan tyme was for to go to bedde the kynge wente vnto his bedde & laye and slepte fast. And as the kyng laye & slepte the traytoures false for sworne agaynst theyr homage & feaute came pryuely in to y• kynges chambre / & theyr company with them / & layde an huge table vpon his wombe / & with men pressed & helde fast down the foure corners of y• table on his body / wherwith y• good man awoke and was wonders sore adrad to be deed there & slayne / & turned his body tho vp so downe. Than toke y• fals traytours & tyraumtes an horne & put it in to his foundement as depe as they myght / & toke a spyt of coper bre¯nynge / & put it through the horne in to his body / and ofte tymes therwith thyrled his bowelles / & so they   slewe theyr lord that nothynge was perceyued / & was buryed at Glocestre.  How kynge Edward spoused Philip the erles doughter of Henaud at Yorke. ANd after Chrystmasse than next folowynge syr Iohn of Henaud brought with hym Philip his broders doughter yt was erle of Henaud his nece in to Englond / & kyng Edward spoused her at Yorke wt moche honour. And syr Iohn of Bothum bisshop of Ely and syr William of Melton archebysshop of yorke sange the masse ye sonday on ye euen of the co¯uersion of saint Paule / in ye yere of grace. M .CCC .xxvij. But bycause that the kynge was yonge and tender of age whan he was crowned / full many wronges were done whyle yt his fader lyued bycause yt he byleued the coumseylers that were fals aboute hym to do otherwyse than reason wolde / wherfore grete harme was done to ye realme & to ye kyng / & all men directed it to ye kynges dede / & it was not so / almyghty god it knoweth. Wherfore it was ordeyned at ye kynges crownyng yt the kyng for his tender age sholde be gouerned by .xij. of the gretest lordes of Englonde / without whome no thynge shold be done / that is to saye / the archebysshop of Caumterbury / the archebisshop of yorke / the bisshop of wynchestre / & the bysshop of Herford / the erle of Lancastre / the erle Marshall / & ye erle of Kent yt were ye kynges vncles / & the erle of Garen / syr Thomas wake / syr Henry Percy / syr Olyuer of yngham / & Iohn of Roos barons. All these were sworne truly for to coumseyle ye kyng / & they shold answere euery yere in ye parlyament of yt that sholde be done in the tyme of theyr gouernall. But ye ordynaumce was soone vndone / & that was moche harme to all Englo¯de. For the kyng & all the lordes ye  shold  gouerne hym were gouerned and ruled after the ky¯ges moder dame Isabell / & by syr Roger Mortimer. And as they wolde all thynge was done / bothe amonge hye & lowe. And they toke vnto them castels / townes / londes / & rentes / in grete harme & losse to the crowne / & of the kynges estate out of mesure.  How the peas was made bytwene ye Englisshmen & the Scottes / and also of iustyfyenge of Troylebaston. BYnge Edwarde at whytsontyde in the seconde yere of his regne / through the coumseyle of his moder & syr Roger Mortimer ordeyned a parlyament at Northamton. And at that parlyament the kyng through theyr coumseyle / & none other of the londe within age graunted to be accorded with the Scottes in this maner. That all the feautees and homages that the Scottes sholde do vnto the crowne of Englonde forgaue them for euer more by his chartre ensealed. And forthermore an endenture was made of the Scottes vnto kynge Edwarde that was kyng Henryes sone / whiche endenture they called ragman / in the whiche were co¯teyned al ye homages & feautees Fyrst of the kynge of Scotlonde & of all the prelates / erles & barons of ye realme of Scotlonde / wt theyr seales set theron / and other chartres & remembraunces yt kynge Edwarde and his barons had of theyr right in ye foresayd realme of Scotlond / it was forgyuen them agaynst holy chirche. And also with ye blacke crosse of Scotlonde / the whiche ye good kynge Edwarde conquered in Scotlonde / and brought it out of the abbey of Scone / yt is a full precyous relyke. And also forthermore he relesed & forgaue all the londes that the barons of Englonde had in Scotlonde by olde conquest.  And this peas for to be hold and last the Scottes were bounde vnto the kyng in .xxx. M.   pounde of syluer to be payed within thre yere / that is euery yere .x. M. pounde by euen porcyons. And forthermore aboue all this they spake bytwene the partyes aboue sayd / that Dauyd Dritonautier that was kynge Robert the Brus sone ye fals tyraunt & fals forsworne agaynst his othe yt arose agaynst his lyege lorde the noble and good kyng Edward / and falsly made him kyng of Scotlo¯de / that was of ye age of .v. yere. And so through this cursed counseyle Dauid spoused at Barwyk dame Ione of the toure / that was kynge Edwardes syster / as ye gest telleth vpon Mary Magdaleyns daye / in ye yere of grace. M .CCC. and .xxviij. to grete harme & empayrynge of all the kynges blode / wherof that gentyll lady came / alas ye tyme / for wonders moche was that fayre damoysell desparaged syth that she was maryed agaynst all the comyns assent of Englonde. And fro the tyme that Brute had conquered Albion / & named the londe after his owne name Brytayn / that now is called Englonde / after the name of Engyst / and so the realme of Scotlonde was holden of the realme of Englonde / & of the crowne by feaute & homage. For Brute conquered that londe / and gaue it to Albanack that was his seconde sone / and he called that londe Albayn after his own name / so that the heyres that came after hym sholde holde of Brute and of his heyres / that is to saye of ye kynges of Brytayne by feaute & homage. And from that tyme vnto this tyme of kynge Edwarde / the realme of Scotlonde was holden of the realme of Englonde by feaute & seruyce as aboue is sayd in ye Cronycles of Englonde & of Scotlonde / and bereth wytnes more plenarly.  And cursed be the tyme that this parliament was holden at Northamton. For there through fals coumseyle the kyng was there falsly dysheryted / & yet he was within age. And yet whan that kyng Edward was put out of his royalte of Englonde / yet men put not hym out of ye feautees & seruyce of Scotlonde / ne of the fraumchyses dysheryted hym for euermore. And neuertheles the grete lordes of Englo¯de were agaynst to confyrme ye peas & the trewse aboue sayd / saue onely quene Isabell yt was the kynges moder Edwarde / and the bysshop of Ely / and the lorde Montmer. But reason & lawe wolde not yt a fynall peas sholde be made bytwene them without the comyn assent of Englonde.  Of the debate yt was bytwene quene Isabell & syr Henry erle of La¯castre & of Leycestre / & of the rydynge of Bedford. WHan ye foresayd Dauid had spoused dame Ione of the toure in the towne of Barwik (as before is sayd) the Scottes in despyte of the Englysshmen called dame Ione ye coumtesse make peas for the cowardly peas that was ordeyned. But the kynges persone bare al the wyte & blame with wronge of the makynge of the accorde. And all was done through the quene & Roger M rtymer. And it was not longe after that ye quene Isabell ne toke in to her handes all the lordshyp of Pountfret almoost all ye londes that were of ony value that apperteyned to the crowne of Englonde. So yt the kynge had not for to dyspende but of his vses & of his excheker. For the quene Isabell & Mortimer had a gre e meyny of theyr retynue that folowed euermore the kynges courte / & went & toke ye kynges pryces for her peny worthes at good chepe. Wherfore the coumtre yt they came in / were full sore adrad and almoost destroyed of them. Than began ye cominalte of Englonde for to haue enuy to Isabell the quene that so moche loued her before   whan she came agayne fro Fraumce for to pursue the fals traytours ye Spensers. And in that same tyme ye false traytour Robert of Holand that be rayed his lord syr Thomas of Lancastre / was than delyuered out of pryson / & was wonders preuy with ye quene Isabell & also with Roger Mortimer. But that auayled hy¯ but lytell / for he was taken at Myghelmasse next folowyng as he rode toward the quene Isabell to London / & syr Thomas wyther smote of his heed besydes the towne of saynt Albons. And this syr Thomas dwelled with syr Henry erle of Lancastre / & he put hym asyde for drede of the quene / for she loued hym wonders moche / & prayed vnto ye kyng for hym yt the same Thomas myght be exiled out of Englonde. And ye noble erle syr Henry of Lancastre had oftentymes herde the comyn damour of ye Englysshmen / of yt disease that was done in Englonde / & also for dyuers wronges yt were done to ye comyn people. Of the whiche the kyng bare the blame wt wronge. For he was yonge & tender of age. And thought as a good man for to do awaye and slake the sclaundre of ye kynges person / yf that he myght in ony maner wyse / so as ye kyng was therof nothynge gylty / wherfore he was in peryll of his lyfe. And so he assembled all his retenaunces & went & spake wt them of ye kynges honour / & also for to amende his estate. And syr Thomas Brotherton erle Marshall / and syr Edmond of wodstok yt were the kynges vncles / & also men of London made theyr othe for to maynteyn hym in that same quarell. And theyr cause was this / that the kyng sholde holde his hous and his meyny as a king ought to do / & haue all his ryalte / & that ye quene Isabell  shold  deliuer out of her handes in to ye kynges handes all maner lordshyppes / rentes / townes & castels yt apperteyned vnto ye crowne of Englo¯de as other quenes dyd before her / and meddle with none other thynge. And also that syr Roger Mortimer  shold  abyde & dwell vpon his owne londes / for ye whiche londes he had holpen to disheryte moche people / in so moche that ye comyn people were destroyed through wrongfull takynge. And also to enquyre how & by whome the kynge was betrayed & falsly deceiued at Stan hope / and through whose coumseyle that the Scottes went away by nyght from the kynge. And also how and through whose coumseyle ye ordynaunce that was made at the kynges crownacyon was put downe / that is for to saye / that the kynge for amendement and helpyng of the realme / and in honour of hym sholde be gouerned and ruled by .xij. of the gretest and wisest lordes of the realme / and without them sholde nothynge be graumted ne done (as before is sayd) the whiche couenauntes were malycyously put downe from the kynge / wherfore many harmes shames & reproues haue fallen to the kyng and his realme. And that is to vnderstand for as moche as Edward somtyme kyng of Englonde was ordeyned by assent of the comynalte in playne parlyament for to be vnder the warde & gouernaunce of Henry erle of Lancastre his cosyn for saluacyon of his body / he was taken out of ye castel of Ken worth where he was in warde / & through colour of quene Isabell & of Mortimer wtout consent of ony parliament they toke & lad hy¯ where as neuer after none of his  ynrede myght speke wt hy¯ / & after tray toursly murdred hym / for whose deth arose a sclaundre through all christendom whan it was done. And also ye tresour yt syr Edward of Carnaruan left in many places   englo¯d & in wales was wasted & borne awaye without ye wyll of kyng Edward his sone / in destruccion of hym   and all his folke.  Also through whose coumseyle that the kyng gaue vp ye kyngdom of Scotlonde / for ye whiche realme the kynges auncesters had full sore trauayled / and so dyd many a noble ma¯ for theyr ryght / & was delyuered to Dauid that was Robert ye Brus sone al ye right that no ryght had to ye realme / as al the worlde it wyst.  And also by whome ye charters & remembraumces yt they had of the right of Scotlo¯de were taken out of the tresoury & taken to the Scottes the kynges enemyes / to the dysherytyng of hym & his successours / & to grete harme of his lyeges / & grete reprefe to all Englysshmen for euermore.  Also wherfore  ame Ione of ye toure kyng Edwardes syster was disparaged & maryed to Dauid yt was Robert ye Brus sone / yt was a traytour & enemy to Englo¯d / & through whose coumseyle she was taken in to our enemyes handes out of Englo¯de.  And in the meane whyle the good erle Henry of Lancastre & his company toke coumseyle how these poyntes aboue said might be amended to ye worship of ye king & to his profyte / & to ye profyte also of his lyeges.  And the quene Isabell through coniectynge & subtylte & also of Mortymer let ordeyn a parlyament at Salysbury. And at that parlyament was Mortimer made erle of Marche agaynst all the barons wyll of Englonde in preiudyce of ye kyng & his crowne. And syr Iohn of Eltham ye kynges broder was gyrt with a swerde of Cornewayle / & tho was called erle of Cornewayl. And euermore quene Isabell {pro}cured so moche anenst her sone the king / yt she had ye warde of ye foresaid syr Edward & of his londes. And at that parlyament ye erle of Lancastre wold not come / but ordeyned his power agaynst quene Isabell & Mortymer / and men of London ordeyned them with .v .C. men of armes. Whan quene Isabell wyst of the doynge / she swore by god & by his names full angerly / that in an euyll tyme he thought vpon those poyntes. Than sent the quene Isabell & Mort mer after theyr retynue / & after ye kynges retynue so that they had ordeyned amo¯ge them an huge hoost. And they so coumseyled the kyng / that vpon a nyght they rode. xxiij myle towarde Bedford / where as ye erle of Lancastre was with his company & thought to haue destroyed hym / & that nyght she rode besyde the kyng her sone as a knight armed for drede of deth. And it was done the kynge to vnderstande ye the erle Henry of La¯castre & his company wolde haue destroyed the kyng & his coumseyle for euermore / wherfore ye kyng was somdele towardes hym heuy and anoyed.  Whan ye erle Marshall & the erle of Kent the kynges broder herde of these tydynges / they  ode so in message bytwene them / that the kyng graunted hym his peas to the erle Henry of Lancastre for a certayne raunsom of. x . M. pounde. But that was neuer payed after warde. And these were ye lordes ye helde with syr Henry of Lancastre / syr Henry Beamont / syr Fouk fitz war  syr Thomas Rocelyn / syr Willyam Trussell syrr Thomas wyther / & aboute an  ondred knyghtes moo than were to hym co¯sen ted / & all those were ex led through coumseyle of quene Isabell and of Mor mer for Mortymer wayted for to haue theyr lo¯des yf yt he might through ony maner coniecting / for he was to co us & had to moche wyll / & that was grete py e.  How kynge Edwarde went ouer the see for to do his homage to the kynge of Fraunce for the duchy of Guyen. IT was not longe after ye the kyng of Fraumce through coumseyle of his Douzepers sent vnto kynge Edward of   Englonde that he sholde come to Parys and do his homage (as reason it wolde) for y• duchy of Guyen / & so through coumseyle of y• lordes of Englonde kynge Edward went ouer y• see / & at y• Ascencyon tyde he came to Parys the thyrd yere of his regne for to do his homage vnto the kyng of Fraumce. And the kyng receyued his homage / & made of hym moche ioye & worship. But wham kyng Edward had done his homage / hastely he was sente for in to Englonde through y• quene Isabell his moder / & anone hastely he came agayn in to Englond vpon whytsonday wtout takynge leue of y• kyng of Fraumce / wherfore he was wonders wroth.  How syr Roger Mortimer bare hym proudly and wonders hye. ANd now shall ye here of syr Roger Mortimer of wygmore that desyred & coueyted to be at an hye estate so that y• kyng graumted hym to be called erle of Marche / throughout all his lordshyp. And he became so proude & so hauteyn y• he wold lese & forsake the name y• his elders had euer before / & for y• cause he let call hym erle of Marche / and none of the comyns of Englonde durst call hy¯ by other name. For he was called so by the kynges crye / y• men sholde call hym erle of Marche. And Mortimer bare hy¯ so hauteyne & so proude / that wonder it was for to wyte / & also dysguysed hym with wonders ryche clothes out of all maner of reason / bothe of shapynge & of werynge. Wherof y• Englysshmen had grete wonder / how & in what maner he myght contryue or fynde suche maner pride / & they sayd amo¯ge them comynly that his pryde sholde not longe endure. And y• same tyme sir Geffrey Mortimer that was Mortimers sone let call hym kyng of foly / & so it befell afterwarde in dede. For he was so full of pryde and of wretchednes / that he held a roumde table in Wales to all men that came thyder / & coumterfeyted the doynge & the maner of kyng Arthurs table / but openly he fayled. For the noble kyng Arthur was the moost noble lorde of renome y• was in all the world in his tyme / & yet came neuer none suche after / for al y• noble knyghtes in all chrystendom of dedes of armes assayed dwellyng wt kyng Arthur / & helde hym for theyr lord & souerayn. And that was well seen / for he conquered in batayle a Romayn that was called Froll / and gate of hym the realme of Fraumce / & slewe hym wt his own handes. And also he faught with a gyaunt y• was called Dinabus & slewe hym / y• had rauysshed fayre Eleyn that was kynge Howelles nece kynge of lytell Brytayn. And after he slewe in batayle y• emperour of Rome that was called Lucie / that had assembled agaynst kynge Arthur for to fyght with hym so moche people of Romayns & Phethis & sarasyns / y• no man coude nombre them / & he discomfited them all as y• story telleth.  And in y• same tyme the comyn voyce spronge in Englonde through coniectynge & ordynaumce of the frere prechers / that syr Edward of Car naruan / that was kyng Edwardes fader / of whome the gest telleth / sayd y• he was alyue in y• castell of Corf / wherfore al y• comyns of Englo¯de almoost were in sorowe & drede whether it were so or not For they wyst not how traytoursly Mortimer had done hym to be murdred.  How Edmond of wodstok y• was erle of Kent & the kynges broder Edward of Carnaruan was heded at Wynchestre. ANd on a certayne tyme it befell so that syr Edmond of wodstock erle of Kent spake vnto the pope Iohn   the .xxij. at Auinyon & sayd y• almyghty god had often tymes done for Thomas lone of Laneastre many grete myracles to many men & women / y• were through dyuerse maladyes vndone (as vnto the worlde) & through his prayer they were brought to theyr helth / & so syr Edmond prayed y• pope hertely y• he wolde graumt hy¯ grace y• the foresayd Thomas might be translated. But y• pope sayd nay / that he  shold  not be translated vnto the tyme he were better certyfyed of the clergy of Englonde and seen by theyr obedyence what thynge god had done for y• loue of saynt Thomas of Lancastre after y• suggestyon that y• foresayd erle of Kent had made to hym. And whan this Edmond saw y• he might not spede of his purpose as touchyng the translacyon / he prayed hy¯ of coumseyle as touchyng syr Edward of Carnaruan his broder / & sayd not longe ago he was king of Englonde / what thynge myght best be done as touching his deliueraumce / syth y• a comyn fame is through Englonde y• he is alyue & safe. Whan the pope herde hym tell y• syr Edward was alyue / he commaumded the erle vpon his benyson y• he sholde helpe wt all the power y• he myght y• he were delyuered out of prison / & saue his body in all y• he myght / & to brynge this thynge to an ende he assoyled hym & his company (a pe na et culpa) & al tho y• holpe to his deliueraunce. Than toke Edmond of wodstok his leue of the pope & came agayne in to Englonde. And whan syr Edmond was comen / some of y• frere prechers came & sayd y• syr Edwarde his broder yet was alyue in y• castell of Corf / vnder y• keping of syr Thomas Gurney. Tho sped hym the foresayd Edmond as fast as he might tyll he came to y• castel of Corf / & aqueynted hym and spake so fayre with Iohn Daueryll / that was constable of y• same castell / & gaue him ryche gyftes to haue acqueyntaunce of hym & to knowe of his coumseyle. And thus it befel y• the foresayd syr Edmond prayed specially to tell hym pryuely of his lorde his broder syr Edward / yf y• he lyued or were deed / & yf he were alyue he prayed hy¯ ones to haue a syght of hym. And this syr Iohn Daueryll was a hye herted man & full of courage / & answered shortly to syr Edmond & sayd / that syr Edward his broder was in helth & vnder his kepyng / & durst not shewe hym to no man syth it was defended hy¯ in y• kynges half Edward y• was Edwardes sone of Carnaruan / & also by the commaumdement of quene Isabell y• kynges moder / & of syr Roger Mortymer / y• he shold shewe his body to no man of the world / saue onely to them vpom lyf & ly¯me & disheryting of his heyres for euermore But the fals traytour falsly lyed / for he was not in his warde / but he was taken thens & lad to y• castell of Berkeley by syr Thomas Gurney / by commaumdement of Mortimer tyll he was deed as before is sayd / but syr Edmond of wodstok wyst no thynge y• syr Edwarde his broder was deed / whervpon he toke a lettre to kyng Edward his broder as to his worthy lorde. And receyued y• lettre of hy¯ & behight hym to do his message wtout ony fayle. And with y• syr Edmond toke leue of the foresayd Iohn & went in to his own coumtre & lordshyp in Kent y• he had there. And anone as this same Iohn wyst y• syr Edmond was gone in to Kent his own lordship / he went in all the haste y• be might fro the castel of Corf & came to syr Roger Mortimer / & toke hym y• lettre y• syr Edmond of wodstok erle of Kent had taken hym closed & ensealed wt his owne seale. And whan syr Roger Mortimer had receyued the lettre / he vnclosed it & sawe what was conteyned therin / & began to rede it / wherof y• begy¯nynge was this.  Worshyps & reuerence with broders   legeaunce and subie cyon. Syr knyght worshipful & dere broder / yf it please you I praye you hertely y• ye be in good com forte / for I shall so ordeyne for you / that ye shall come out of prison & be deliuered of that disease that ye be in. And vnderstande of your grete lordshyp y• I haue to myne assentyng almoost all the grete lordes of Englonde with all theyr apparayle / y• is to saye / with armure / wt tresour without nombre / for to maynteyne your quarell / so ferforth that ye shall be kynge agayn as ye were before / & that they haue sworne to me vpom a boke / & as well prelates as erles & barons. Whan syr Roger Mortimer sawe & vnderstode the myght & the strengthe of the lettre / anone his herte for wrath began to boll & euyll hert bare toward syr Edmond of wodstok y• was erle of Kent / & wt all the haste that he might he went vnto dame Isabell y• quene y• was y• kynges moder & shewed her syr Edmondes lettre / his wyll & his purpose / & how that he had coniected & ordeyned to put downe kyng Edward of wyndsore her sone of his ryalte & of his kyngdom. Now certes syr Roger sayd she / hath syr Edmond done so now by my faders soule sayd she I wyll be therof auenged / yf that god graumt me lyfe / & that in a shorte tyme. And with y• the quene Isabel went to king Edward her sone there as he was at the parlyament at Wynchestre for to amende the wronges & the trespaces that were done amonge the people of his realme / & she toke and shewed hym the lettre that syr Edmond of wodstock had made and ensealed with his owne seale / and badde hym vpon her blessynge that he sholde be auenged vpon syr Edmonde as vpon his deedly enemy. Than was the quene sore wroth towarde syr Edmonde erle of Kent / and cessed neuer to praye vnto her sone tyll that he had sent in all the haste after hym. And vpon that the kyng sent by his lettres after syr Edmond of wodstok / that he sholde come & speke wt hym at Wynchestre all maner thynges lefte. And whan syr Edmond sawe y• the king sent after hym with his lettres ensealed he hasted hym in all that he myght tyll that he came to wynchestre. But whan the quene wyst that syr Edmonde was comen to wynchestre / anone she went & prayed so fast vnto kynge Edwarde her sone that y• good erle was arested anone and ladde vnto y• barre before Robert of Hamond y• was Crowner of the kynges housholde / & he assocyed to hym syr Roger Mortimer. And than spake the fore sayd Robert & said. Syr Edmond erle of Kent / ye shall vndersta¯de that it is done vs to wyte / & pry¯cypally vnto our lyege lorde the kynge Edwarde of Englonde almyghty god hym saue & kepe / that ye be his deedly enemy & a traytour / & also a comyn enemy vnto the realme / & that ye haue ben aboute many a daye for to make preuy delyueraumce of syr Edward somtyme king of Englonde your broder the whiche somtyme was put downe of his royalte by y• comyn assent of y• lordes of Englonde in appeasynge of our lorde the kynges estate / & also of his realme. Than answered the good man & sayd. Forsothe syr vnderstande well y• I was neuer traytour to my kyng / ne to the realme / & that I do me on god & on all the worlde / & therfore by my kynges leue I shall it preue & defende as a man ought to do. Than sayd Mortymer. Syr Edmonde it is so ferforth knowen y• it may not be well gaynsayd / & that in presence of all that be here it shall be well proued Now had this fals Mortimer the same lettre that syr Edmond had taken to syr Iohn Daueryll in the castell of Corf for to take to kyng Edward his broder that syr Edmonde wyst not of / ne supposed   nothynge y• syr Iohn Daueryll had ben so fals to deliuer his lettre in suche wyse to Mortimer / & thought no maner thynge of the lettre. Than Mortimer sayd to syr Edmonde & shewed y• lettre sealed / & asked him yf that he knewe that lettre & the seale. This syr Edmond loked theron & auysed hym longe tyme on y• print of y• seale / for he myght not se y• lettre wtin / & wyst well y• it was his seale / & thought that it had be¯ some lettre y• had borne no grete charge / & thought nothynge on y• other lettre / & sayd openly in herynge of them all. Ye forsothe this is my seale / & I wyll it not forsake. Loo sayd Mortymer / syrs ye here all what he hath sayd & that he knowlegeth y• this is his lettre & his seale / & now ye shall here what is conteyned therin. And than this Mortimer opened y• lettre y• he had folden a fore togyder / & red it openly worde by worde in hering of them all. And whan y• lettre was red he sayd / loo syrs ye haue herde all that here is wryten / & that he hath knowleged y• this is his lettre & his seale & he may not go therfro. And than they cryed & gaue dome that he sholde be hanged & drawen & his heed smytte¯ of in maner of a traytour / & he & his heyres dysheryted for euermore / & so he was ladde forth & put in to pryson. And whan this was done / & y• quene wyst that he was dampned by waye of y• lawe bothe of lyf and lymme / & his heyres dysheryted for euer more / through open knowlegynge in playn court / wherfore them thought that it were good y• the foresayd syr Edmond were hastely slayne without wytynge of y• kyng / or els the kynge wolde lyghtly forgyue hym his deth / & than it sholde turne them to moche sorowe / so as he was empeched. And anone the quene through counseyle of Mortimer / & wtout ony other counseyle / sente in haste to the baylyfe of wynchestre y• he sholde sinyte of syr Edmondes heed of wod ok erle of Kent without ony maner abydynge or respyte / vpon payne of lyfe & lymme / & that he shold haue none other execucyon bycause of taryenge / not withstandyng the iudgement. Than toke y• baylyfe syr Edmond out of pryson / & ladde hym besyde y• castel of wynchestre / & there they made a gongfermer to smyte of his dyed for none other durst do it. And so he dyed there / alas y• whyle / y• is to say y•.  . day of October / the thyrde yere of kyng Edwardes regne. And whan y• kyng wyst therof / he was wonders sory / & let bury hym at ye frere Minours at winchestre.  Of the deth of syr Roger Mortymer erle of Marche. ANd so it befell at y• tyme that syr Roger Mortimer erle of marche was so proude & so hawteyne y• he helde no lord of the realme his pere. And than became he so couetous that he folowed dame Isabell the quenes courte y• was kyng Edwardes moder / & beset his penyworthes wt the offycers of the quenes houshold in y• same maner y• the kynges officers dyd. And so he made his takyng as touchynge vytayles / & also of caryages / & all he dyd for bycause of e penses and to gadre tresour / & so he dyd without nombre in all that he myght. Than made he hym wonders preuy with the quene Isabell / and so moche lordshyp & retynue he had / that all the grete lordes of Englonde of hym were adrad. Wherfore the kynge & his coumseyle towardes hym were agreued / & ordeyned amonge them to vndo hym through pure reason and lawe / bycause that kynge Edward that was the kynges fader tray oursly through hym was murdred in y• castell of Corf / as before is sayd more playnly in the same parte of this boke of his deth. And some that were of the kynges   counseyle loued Mortimer / & tolde hym in preuite how that the kyng & his counseyle were aboute from daye to daye hym for to destroye & vndo. Wherfore Mortimer was sore anoyed and angry as the deuyll agaynst them yt were of ye kynges coumseyle / & sayd he wolde of them be auenged how so euer he toke on. It was not longe afterward that king Edward and dame Philip his wyfe / & dame Isabell the kynges moder / & syr Roger Mortymer ne went vnto Notyngham there for to soiourne. And so it befel that quene Isabell through counseyle of Mortimer toke to her the keys of ye gates of ye castel of Notyngham / so that no man myght come in nor out by nyght / but through commaumdement of Mortimer / ne ye kynge nor none of his coumseyle. And that tyme it befell so that Mortimer as a deuyll for wrath boyled / & also for wrath ye he had agaynst the kynges men / & pryncypally agaynst them yt had accused hym to the kyng of ye deth of syr Edward his fader. And pryuely a counseyle was taken bytwene quene Isabell & Mortymer & the bysshop of Lyncolne and syr Symond of Bedford & syr Hugh of Trompyngton & other preuy of theyr coumseyle for to vndo them al ye had accused Mortimer vnto ye kynge of his faders deth of treason & of felony. Wherfore all those yt were of the kynges coumseyle wham they wyst of Mortimers castynge / pryuely came to kyng Edwarde & sayd that Mortimer wolde destroye them bycause they had accused hym of kyng Edwardes deth his fader and prayed hym yt he wolde maynteyne them in theyr right. And these were the lordes yt pursued this quarell / syr William of Mountagu / syr Vmfrey de Boghun / syr William his broder / syr Rauf of Stafford / syr Robert of Herford / syr Willyam of Clynton / syr Iohn Neuyll of Nornby and many other of theyr consent / and all these swore vpon a boke to maynteyne the quarell in as moche as they myght. And it befell so after that syr Wyllyam of Mountagu ne none of ye kynges frendes must not be herborowed in the castel for Mortimer / but went and toke theyr herborowe in dyuers places of ye towne of Notyngham. And tho were they sore adrad lest that Mortimer  shold  destroye them / and in haste came vnto kyng Edward syr Willyam of Moumtagu yt than was in ye castell / and pryuely tolde hym that he nor none of his company sholde not take Mortimer without counseyle & helpe of Wyllyam of Eland constable of the same castell. Now truly sayd ye king I loue you well / & therfore I counseyle you that ye go to the foresayd constable and commaunde hym in my name that he be your frende and your helpe for to take Mortimer / all thynge left vpon peryll of lyfe & lymme. Than sayd Moumtagu / syr my lord graumt mercy. Than went forth the foresayd Moumtagu and came to the constable of the castell / and told hym the kynges wyll. And he answered & sayd the kynges wyll shold be done in as moche as he myght / and that he wolde not spare for no maner deth / and so he swore and made his othe. Than sayd syr Willyam of Mountagu to the constable / in herynge of all them that were helpyng vnto the same quarell. Now certes dere frende / vs behoueth to werke and do by your aduyse for to take Mortymer / syth that ye be keper of the castell & haue the keys in your warde. Syr sayd the constable ye shall vnderstande that ye gates of the castell ben locked with the lockes that dame Isabell sente hyther / and by nyght she hath the keys therof & layeth them vnder the leuesell of the bedde tyll on the morowe / and so ye may not come in to the castell by the gates in no maner of wyse / but I knowe an aley that   stretcheth out of the warde vnder ye erth in to ye foresayd castel / yt goth in to ye west whiche aley dame Isabell the quene ne none of her men / nor Mortymer ne none of his company knoweth it not. And so I shall lede you through ye aley / and so ye shall come in to the castel wtout espyenge of ony men yt be your enemyes. And the same nyght syr William Moumtagu & all the lordes of his quarell / & the same constable also wente to hors them / & made semblaumt as it were for to go out of Mortimers syght. But anone as Mortimer herde these tydynges / he wende yt they  wold  haue gone ouer see for fere of hym And anone he & his company toke a coumseyle amonge them for to lette theyr passage / & sent lettres anone to the portes / so that none of the grete lordes sholde go home to theyr own coumtrees but yf they were arested & taken. And amo¯ge other thynges Willyam Eland constable of ye foresayd castell / priuely lad syr William of Moumtagu & his company by the foresayd waye vnder the erth tyl they came in to the castel / & went vp in to the toure where as Mortymer was in. But syr Hugh of Trompyngton theym escryed hydously & sayd. A traytours it is all for nought that ye be comen in to this castell ye shall dye yet an euyl deth euerychone And anone one of them yt was in Mountagues company by with a mace & smote the same Hugh vpon ye heed yt the brayn brast out & fell on ye groumde / & so dyed he an euyll dethe. Than toke they Mortymer as he armed hym at ye toures dore whan he herde ye noyse of them for drede And whan quene Isabell sawe ye Mortymer was taken / she made moche sotowe in hert / and these wordes to them sayd. Now fayr syrs I pray you yt ye do no harme to his body a worthy knyght our welbeloued frende & our dere cosyn. Than went they thens & came & brought Mortimer & presented hym vnto kynge Edward. And he commaunded to brynge hym in safe warde. But anone as they that were consentyng vnto Mortimers doynge herde tell yt he was taken / they went and hydde them / and p urly by nyght wente out of the towne eueryche in to his countree with an heuy herte & mournyng chere / and lyued vpon theyr londes as well as they myght. And so that same yere yt Mortymer was taken he had at his retynue .ix. score knyghtes without squyers and sergeauntes of armes and fote men. And than was Mortymer ladde to London / & syr Symond of Bedford was ladde with hym / and was taken to the constable of the toure to kepe. But afterwarde was Mortymers lyf examyned at Westmynster before the kynge & before all the grete lordes of Englonde / for peryll that myght fall to the realme / & to enquyre also whiche were consentynge to syr Edwardes deth the kynges fader / and also through whome the Scottes escaped fro Scanhope in to Scotlonde without the wyll of kyng Edward. And also how yt charter of Ragman was delyuered vnto the Scottes / wherin the homages & frautees of ye lordes of Scotlonde were conteyned / that the Scottes sholde do euer more vnto the Englysshe kynge for the realme of Scotlo¯de / wherfore in his absence he was dampned to be draw  & hanged for his treason. And this myschefe came to hym on saynt Andrewes euen / in the yere of ye incarnacyon of our lorde Iesu Chryst. M .CCC. and rxx.  Now kyng Edward gate agayn vnto hym gracyously ye homages & f au es of Scotlonde / wherof he was put out through false coumseyle of quene Isabell his moder & syr Roger Mortymer / that was newly made erle of March .  NOw haue ye herd how syr Iohn Bayloll in the tyme of peas was chosen to be kyng of Scotlonde / bycause that he came of ye eldest doughter of the erle Dauid of Huntyngton yt was kyng Alysaunders broder of Scotlond yt dyed without heyre of his body begoten. And how this Iohn made his feaute and homage to kyng Edward Henryes sone ye thyrde for his londes of Scotlonde. And how he afterwarde wtsayd his homage through coumseyle of the Scottes / in the yere of our lorde. M .CC .lxxiiij. and sent vnto the pope through a fals suggestion that he made his othe vnto the foresayd kyng Edward ouer his estate & his wyl of the whiche othe ye pope hym assoyled through his bulles to hy¯ sent. And anone as kyng Edward wyst therof / he ordeyned anone his barons & came to Barwyk & conquered the towne / at whiche conquest there were slayne .xxv. M. and vij .C. and Bayloll yt was kyng of Scotlonde came & yelded hym to good kynge Edward / & the kyng afterward delyuered him out of ye toure of London / & all ye grete lordes wt hym that tho were taken at Barwyk / & gaue them saufconduyte to go in to Scotlonde. And the Scottes  ith through theyr falsnes warred vpon the good kyng Edward. And whan syr Iohn Bayloll kyng of Scotlonde sawe all this he went ouer see vnto Dunpier and lyued there vpon his londes as wel as he myght tyll yt the Scottes wold amende them of theyr mysoedes & trespace &  ad wt hy¯ syr Edward his sone / wherfore ye Scottes in despyte of hym called hym syr Iohn Turnlabaerd / for bycause that he wolde not offende ne trespace agaynst ye good kyng Edward of Englonde. And so he forsoke his realme of Scotlonde / and set therof but lytel pryce. And this syr Iohan dwelled longe tyme in Fraumce tyll yt he dyed there. And syr Edward his sone receyued his herytage / & dyd homage to ye kyng of Fraumce / for his londes of Dunpier. And so it befell afterward that Edward yt was Iohn Baylols sone had wt hym a squyer of englo¯de that was borne in yorkshyre / yt was called Iohn of Barnaby / & this Edwarde Bayloll loued hym moche / & was nygh hym and full preuy. And so this Iohn of Barnaby was in debate with a frensshe man in ye towne of Dumpier / & so he slewe hym & went his waye in all ye haste yt he myght in to ye castell for to haue helpe of his  lord.  And anone came ye officers of ye towne to take Iohn of Barnaby as a felon / & syr Edward his  lord  holpe hym & rescowed hym / & by night made him go out of ye castell / & so he went his waye & came in to Englonde wtout ony harme. And whan ye kyng of Fraumce sawe yt syr Edward had rescowed his felon / he became wonders wrothe agaynst syr Edward / & anone let arest hym / & toke in to his ha¯des all his londes. Than dwelled syr Edward in pryson vnto ye tyme yt syr Henry of Beaumont came in to Fraumce / the whiche Henry was somtyme erle of Angos in Scotlonde through his wyfe & was put out therof wham ye accordement was bytwene Englonde and Scotlond through quene Isabell & Roger Mortimer & theyr company / for ye maryage yt she made bytwene Dauyd yt was Robert ye Brus sone & dame Ione of ye toure kyng Edwardes syster of Englo¯de / & well vnderstode this yt at ye ende he shold come to his ryght / but yf it were syr Edwarde Bayloll yt was ryght heyre of ye realme of Scotlonde. And the kyng of Fraunce Lowys loued moche this syr Henry / & he was with hym ful preuy / & thought for to make a delyueraumce of syr Edwarde Bayloll yf he myght in ony maner of wyse. Tho prayed he ye kyng ye it wolde please his noble grace to graumt hym syr   Edward Baylols body vnto ye next parlyament that he myght lyue wt his own tentes in the meane tyme / & yt he myght stande to be iudged wt his peres at ye parlyament. And ye kyng graumted hym his prayer / & made the foresayd Edward to be delyuered out of pryson in the maner aboue said. And anone as he was out of prison / syr Henry toke hym forth wt hym & ladde hym in to Englo¯de / & made hym dwell pryuely at ye maner of Sandhall vpon Ouse in Yorkeshyre with the lady Vescy. And so he ordeyned him there an huge retynue of Englysshemen & also of alyens for to conquere agayne his herytage. And so he gaue moche siluer to the sowdyours & to alyens for to helpe hym And they behyght for to helpe hym in yt they myght / but they fayled hym at his moost nede. And at yt tyme Donald erle of Moryf herde tell how yt syr Edwarde Baylol was priuely come in to Englo¯de & came to hym & made grete ioye of his comynge agayn / and sayd to hym & behyght hym yt all ye grete lordes of Scotlonde shold be to hym attendaumt / &  shold  holde hym for kynge as ryght heyre of Scotlo¯de / & dyd to hy¯ homage & feaute. Than came syr Henry of Beaumont to kynge Edwarde of Englonde / & prayed hym in ye waye of charite that he wolde graumt of his grace to syr Edward Bayloll that he myght safely go by londe from Sandhal vnto Scotlo¯de to co¯quere his ryght & herytaunce in Scotlonde. The kynge answered & sayd. Yf that I suffre Bayloll go through my londe in to Scotlonde / the people  wold  saye yt I shold be assentyng vnto ye company. Now syr I praye you that ye wolde gyue hym leue to take wt hym sowdyours of Englysshe men yt they myght safely lede hy¯ through your londe in to Scotlo¯de. And syr vpon this couenaunt yt yf it so befall (as god it forbydde) he be dyscomfyted in batayle through the Scottes / that I & also all ye lordes that holde wt Bayloll ben for euer more out of your rentes that we haue in Englonde. And there ye kyng vpon this couenaunt graunted theyr bone as touchynge hym & those yt were of the same quarell the whiche claymed for to haue londes & rentes in ye realme of Scotlo¯de And these were ye names of those lordes that pursued this foresayd quarell yt is to saye / syr Edward Bayloll the whiche chalenged the realme of Scotlonde, syr Henry Beaumont erle of Angos / syr Dauid of Stroboly erle of Atheles / syr  frey of Mombray / Walter Comyn and many other yt were put out of  rytage in Scotlonde whan ye   made bytwene Englonde & S    before is sayd. And ye shall   that these lordes toke wt them .v .C.   of armes and .ij. M. archers &   & tho wente in to shyppe at   and sayled by the see tyll that they   vnto Scotlonde / & came to londe   kehorne .xij. myle from sayn  Ioh  towne. And anone sente out theyr  pes agayne / for that they sholde no    hurt ne empayred / neyther that no man sholde go in to ye shyppes agayn though that they had nede / but abyde all   and not  ee but stande / & rather   deth than flee for to mayn    quarell. Whan the erle of Fi  a   man & a sterne herde that   comen for to take the londe of Scotlonde he came in haste to kynkehorne with xij. M. scottes for to destroye hym that he sholde not come to londe. But syr Edwarde Bayloll & his company dyscomfyted hym there / at ye whiche discomfyture syr Alysaumder of Seron was there slayne / & many other. The erle of Fyffe was tho sore & full yll ashamed / that so lytell a company had dyscomfy d hym and shamefully put hym & all his company   that were alyue for to flee. Than came syr Edward Bayloll & toke ye coun tre all aboute hym tyll he came vnto the abbey of Dunfermelin / & there he foumde vytayles for hym & for his folke / and amonge all thy¯ges he foumde in a chambre aboute .v .C. of grete staues of fyne oke with longe pykes of yren & of stele / & he toke them & deliuered them to the moost strongest men of his company. And anone after he went from thens & lodged hym in a felde two myle fro saynt Iohannes towne. And whan the burgeyses of the towne herde how the erle of Fiffe was dysco¯fyted through Bayloll / they were fore adrad / & brake theyr brydges yt they had made ouer ye water of Erne / so that Baylol myght not go ouer / wherfore he lodged hym there all yt nyght / but lytell hede he toke of rest / & sayd vnto his people. Now dere lordes ye knowe full well that we be now lodged bytwene our enemyes / & yf they may vs hampre there is no bote but deth / wherfore yf we abyde styll here all this nyght / I wene it shall turne vs to moche harme. For ye power of Scotlonde may euer wexe & encreace and we may not so do / & we be but lytell people agaynst them / wherfore I praye you for ye loue of almighty god make we vs bolde & hardy / & yt we may myghtely take the Scottes this night / and boldly warre vpon them / & let vs pursue them this nyght / & yf they be through vs trauayled & se our hardynes / other scottes that se them so trauayled and wery / the sorer wyll they be adrad wt vs to fyght / & fyersly than shall we fyght with them & on them pursue / so yt through y• grace of god al y• worlde shall speke of y• dough tynes of our chyuairy. And syrs vnderstande well that al the company y• came with syr Edward Bayloll graumted well to y• coumseyle / & were therof ryght glad / and anone pursued vpon the Scottes y• they became wonders wery. And Bayloll & his company sore folowed them / & did them moche harme & sorow through theyr assaut / so y• they myght not for feblenes them helpe / and for lytell people. But tho sayd y• Scottes amonge them / what is now befall that so lytell people as Bayloll hathe in wynge dothe vs so moche trauayle & sorowe. Now certes it semeth vs that he werketh by grace / for he is wonders gracyous in his quarell / & we certes shal be deed or that we may come to hy¯ vs for to yelde / syth that his fader set of vs no pryce. And amonge all other thynges Bayloll & his people passed the water of Erne / so that syr Roger of Swynerton the sone was fyers & angry & went forth / & they sawe people of armes full well arayed / and forth they went vnto them & with them faught / & slewe & toke as many as wolde abyde. And neuertheles at yt assaut they wende it had ben the grete hoost of Scotlonde. And whan it came to the morowe they gadred them togyder and rested them a whyle. And whyle ye englisshmen rested them / the noble baron Thomas Vescy & the noble baron of stafford pricked theyr horses vp & down by ye hylles for to kepe the estres of y• coumtree / & as they prycked vp and down they sawe a grete hoost of good araye ordeyned in theyr wynges with helmes and sheldes shynynge comynge vpon them. And there came tho two lordes agayn to Baylols folke / and sayd. Now for the loue of god be of good comforte / for ye shall haue batayle anone right. And tho spake syr Fouke ye sone of Gareyne a baron of grete renome and of dedes of armes. Syrs vndersta¯de what I wyll saye. I haue seen many dyuers wynges / as wel amonge sarasyns and iewes as amonge y• scottes / & yet sawe I neuer the fourth parte of the wynge fyght / & therfore yf ye wyll abyde our   enemyes we be ynough to fight against them. But yf we be not of good hert & of good courage we be but lost / & therfore for the loue of god let vs take to vs good herte / & let vs be bolde / & thynke we neuer on our wyues ne on our children / but onely to co¯quere our enemyes in batayle & through the helpe of our lorde god we shall them ouercome. And with yt came the hoost of the Scottes towarde them full surely & agaynst syr Edward Bayloll in thre bataylles well arayed in armure / & wonders fyersly they came towarde Baylols company. But wham syr Donald erle of Marcil that was with y• Scottes sawe all this / he said to Robert Brus the sone of Robert the Brus these wordes. Syr Roberte sayd he / full sore me forthynketh at my herte yt these people that Bayloll hathe brought wt hym sholde dye with dynt of scottes swerdes lyth yt they be chrysten men as we be / & therfore me thy¯keth yt it were grete charite to sende vnto them for to yelde them to our mercy / & raunsom them through greuous raunsom / for as moche as they haue taken our londe & done yll. Now certes sayd syr Robert y• Brus / I haue wel perceyued that yu art an enemy & a traytour to Scotlonde / syth that yu wylt consent to saue our deedly enemyes / yt haue done vs so moche sorowe & shame / & now it semeth well that ye be of theyr assent. Now certes Roberte (sayd syr Donald) falsly ye lye / I am not of theyr company ne of theyr consent / & that hastely ye shall se / for I wyll fyght wt them rather than ony of this company / & certes syr Roberte sayd he I shal in maugre of thy heed assayle them or thou. And with that they prycked theyr stedes fyersly on Gaskmo re / & theyr wynges them folowed on a re¯ge / & tho came they & mette wt Bayloll & his company at an hangynge bough of the more in a strayte passage / and so fast they hasted them vnto the englysshmen that thousandes fell to the groumde eche ouer other in to an hepe bothe hors & ma¯ Syr Bayloll & his men myghtely stode agaynst them & fast slewe the Scottes to the groumde / & many they fore wounded so longe tyll that they stode vpon them & foyned them wt theyr swerdes & speres through theyr bodyes / and full sore they were trauayled vpon them / tyll yt they became wonders wery / & wyst not what for to do. And y• Scottes that were lefte alyue fledde away for to saue themselfe in the best maner that they myght. And tho pursued them syr Edwarde Ba  and his men / & slewe of them tyll it was night. And fro thens they went to saynt Iohns towne / and toke it & helde them there / and vytayled themselfe at theyr owne wyll / for they foumde ynough wher with to make them mery. Than made Bayloll his men yt were wounded go to shyppe for to sayle in to Englonde to   theyr woumdes. And in y• tyme there was a flemyng in y• see a stronge thefe & a robber yt was called Crab / & this flem  was dryue¯ out of Flaumdres for his wyckednes / & therfore he came in to scotlond to holde with y• scottes / & dyd as me e harme to y• Englisshmen as he myght to And this Crab mette this Bay e s men in y• see yt were wounded before in baray e that were sent agayn in to Englonde   to hele theyr woumdes / & this Crab gaue to them a grete assaure and wold haue slayne them. But y• Englysshmen defended them manfully & dysco¯fyced Crab & his company / & he fledde in to Scotlonde. And as he came towarde saynt Iohns towne / he foumde a grete company of Scottes yt were comen agayn togyder after y• discomfyture of Gaskemore the whiche besyeged Bayloll & his men in the same towne of saynt Iohn. And anone tolde to the Scottes how that he was discofyted   of y• Englysshmen that were wounded at Gaskmore y• went towarde Englonde for to hele theyr woumdes / & sayd to the scottes yt they sholde haue no power ne myght nor grace agaynst Edwarde Bayloll / bycause that he dyscomfyted & empayred all the chiualry of Scotlonde with a handfull of men as to accompte agaynst the Scottes that were slayne / wherfore he coumseyled to remeue y• siege from saynt Iohns towne / & kepe them in y• best maner that they myght. The Scottes vnderstode yt Crab sayd sothe / & forsoke ye syege & went thens by nyght & holpe themselfe in y• best maner yt they myght. Whan this thy¯ge was knowen through Scotlonde how that y• lordes & knyghtes were disco¯fyted at Gaskmore of Scotlond through syr Edward Bayloll / ye shall vnderstande that ye lordes & ladyes & the gentyls of Scotlonde came wonders fast to saynt Iohns towne / & yelded them to Bayloll / & to him dyd homage & feaute for theyr londes / & yelded them to his peas. And he them receiued frely / & fro thens he went to ye abbey of Scone / & there he was crowned kyng of Scotlonde / & after he let crye his peas throughout all the londe. And at yt same tyme it befell that kynge Edward helde his parlyament amonge his lyeges at newe castell vpon Tyne / for to amende y• trespaces & the wronges yt had ben done in his londe / & syr Edward Bayloll king of Scotlonde came to hym thyder / & dyd to hym homage & feaute for y• realme of Scotlonde. And in this maner kyng Edward of Englo¯de gadred agayn his homages & feautees of Scotlond / wherof he was put out through counseyle & assent of dame Isabell his moder / & of syr Roger Mortimer erle of Marche. Than toke Baylol kyng of Scotlonde his leue of kynge Edward of Englonde / & went thens in to his owne londe of Scotlonde & set but lytell by suche as had coumseyled & holpen hym in his quarell / wherfore they went from hym / & went & lyued by theyr londes & rentes in Scotlond. And so it befell not longe afterward that the king of Scotlonde ne remeued & came to the toure of Anand / and there toke his dwellyng / & thyder came to hym a company of knyghtes / stronge men & worthy / and yelded them vnto y• kyng / and bare them so fayre in dede & in coumtenaumce / so that he trusted moche vpon them. And anone as ye traytours sawe yt he trusted moche vpom them / they ordeyned amo¯ge them fyfty in a company / & wolde haue slayne theyr lord y• kyng. But through y• grace of almighty god he brake through a wall an hole in his chambre / & as god wolde escaped theyr trechery / & all his men were slayne / & he escaped wt moche drede vnto ye towne of Cardoyll / & there he helde hy¯ sore anoyed. And this befell on our ladyes euen ye concepcyon. Than sent kyng Edward Bayloll to kyng Edward of Englo¯de how falsly & traytoursly he was in lytell tyme put to shame & sorow through his lyege men / on whom he trusted wonders moche / & prayed hy¯ for the loue of god yt he wolde maynteyn hym & helpe hym agaynst his enemyes The kyng of Englo¯de had of hym grete pyte / & behyght to helpe & socour hym / and sent hym worde that he shold holde hym in the foresayd cite of Cardoyll tyll that he had gadred his power. Than ordeyned kynge Edwarde of Englonde a counseyle at London / & he let gadre his men in dyuers shyres of Englonde. And whan he was all redy / he went toward the towne of Barwyk vpon Twede / & thyder came vnto hym kynge Edward Bayloll of Scotlonde with his power & besyeged the towne / & made without y• towne a fayre towne of pauylyons / & dy ched them all about / so that they had no   drede of the Scottes / & made many assautes wt gonnes & with other engynes to the towne / wherwt they destroyed many fayre houses / and chirches also were beten downe to y• erth with grete stones that spytefully came out of gonnes & of other engynes. Neuertheles y• Scottes kept well the towne / that ye two kynges myght not come therin longe tyme. And the kynges abode there so lo¯ge tyll those that were wtin the town fayled vitayles & also they were so wery of wakynge / yt they wyst not what to do. And ye shall vnderstand yt the Scottes yt were in the towne of Barwyk through y• comyn coum seyle and theyr assent let crye vpon the walles of the towne yt they myght haue peas of the Englysshmen / & therof they prayed the kyng of his grace & mercy / & prayed hy¯ of trewse for .viij. dayes vpon this couenaumt / yt yf they were not rescowed in yt syde of the towne toward Scotlonde of y• Scottes within .viij. dayes / yt they wold yelde them vnto ye kyng & the towne also / & to hold this couenaumt they profred to y• king .xij. hostages out of the towne of Barwyk. Whan the hostages were delyuered to y• kyng / anone they of the towne sent to y• Scottes / & told them of theyr sorowe & myschefe. And y• Scottes came than priuely ouer the water of Twede to y• bought of y• abbey / & syr willyam Diket yt was tho steward of Scotlonde & many other yt came wt hym / put themselfe in grete peryll of theyr lyues at yt tyme / for they came ouer a brydge yt was broken & the stones away / & many of theyr company were there drowned / but the foresayd Wyllyam went ouer & other of his company / & came by y• shippes of Englonde / & slewe in a barge of Hull xvj. men / & after they went in to y• towne of Barwik by ye water syde. Wherfore y• Scottes helde than y• towne rescowed / & asked theyr hostages agayn of the kyng of Englonde. And the kynge sente them worde agayne y• they asked theyr hostages wt wronge / syth that they came in to the towne of Englo¯de syde / for couenaumt was bytwene them yt the towne shold be rescowed by ye halfe of Scotlonde. Than anone commaumded kyng Edward to yelde the towne or he wold hange y• hostages. And the Scottes sayd the towne was rescowed well ynough / and therto they wold them holde. Whan kyng Edward sawe the Scottes breke theyr couenaumt that they had made / he was wonders wroth / & anone let take syr Thomas fitz Willyam & syr Alyfaumder of Feton wardeyn of Barwyk / the whiche Thomas was parsone of Dunbar / & let them be taken fyrst afore that other hostages / by cause that syr Alysaunders faders was keper of the towne. And tho commaunded euery daye two hostages of y• towne tyll that they were all done to dethe / but yf they yelded y• towne / & so he sholde teche them to breke theyr couenaumt. And wham they of the towne herde these tydynges they became wonders sory / & sent to the kyng yt he wolde graumt them other. v . dayes of respyte / so y• bytwene tho hondred men of arntes and .xx. men of armes myght by strength go bytwene them to the towne of Barwik them force vitayle that ye towne must be holde for restowed And yf so were that .xxj. or .xxij. or more were slayne of tho .C. beforesayd that ye towne sholde not be holden for restowed And this couenaumt to be holde¯ they sent to hym other .xij. of y• foresayd towne in hostage. The kyng graumted them theyr prayer / & toke y• hostages on saynt Margaretes euen / in y• yere of grace. M .ccc. & xxxij. the Scottes came pricking fyersly in foure wynges well arayed in armes for to mete kyng Edward of Englonde & Edward ye kyng of Scotlonde & wt theyr power / and came fast & sharply agaynst   euensonge tyme / & the same tyme was flode at Barwik in the water of Twede that no man myght go ouer on his hors nor on fote / & the water was bytwene the two kynges & ye realme of Englonde And that tyme abode the Scottes on ye other syde / bycause yt the Englysshmen sholde haue ben drowned.  This was ye araye of ye scottes how yt they came in batayle agaynst ye two kynges of Englo¯de & of Scotlo¯de. In ye vaumt ward of Scotlonde were these lordes.

And these .lxvj. grete lordes lad all ye other grete lordes aboue sayd in .iiij. batayles / as it is told before all on fote. And kynge Edward of Englonde & Edward Baylloll kyng of Scotlonde had wel apparayled theyr folke in iiij. batayles for to fyght on fote agaynst the Scottes theyr enemyes. And ye Englysshe mynstrels blewe theyr trumpets & theyr claryons / & hidously escryed ye scottes. And tho had euery englyssh batayle two wynges of pryce archers / ye whiche at ye batayl shotte arowes so fast & so sore that the Scottes myght not helpe them selfe / & they smote ye scottes thousandes to the groumde / & they began for to flee fro   the englysshmen to saue theyr lyues. And whan y• scottysshe knaues sawe y• disco¯fyture & the scottes fall fast to y• grounde they fast prycked theyr maysters horses with the spurres for to kepe them fro peryl / & set theyr maysters at no force. And whan y• Englisshmen sawe y• / they lepte on theyr horses & fast pursued y• scottes / and all y• abode they slewe downe ryght. There men might se y• doughtynes of y• noble kyng Edward & of his men / how manly they pursued y• Scottes y• fled for drede. And there men myght se many a scottisshman cast down to y• groumde deed & theyr baners displayed hacked in to peces / & many a good habergeon of stele in the blode bath. And many a tyme y• scottes were gadred in to companyes. But euermore they were discomfited. And so it befell as god wolde y• the Scottes had y• daye no more foyson ne myght agaynst the Englysshmen than .xx. shepe sholde haue agaynst .v. wolues. And so were y• Scottes discomfited / & yet y• Scottes had well .v. men agaynst one Englysshman / & y• batayle was done on Ha ydownhyll besyde y• towne of Barwyk / at y• whiche batayle were slayne of y• Scottes .xxxv. M. vij .C. and .xij. And of Englysshmen but onely .xiiij. and those were fotemen. And this victory befell to y• Englisshmen on saynt Margaretes euen / in y• yere of the incarnacyon of our lord Iesu Chryst M .CCC .xxxij. And whyle this doynge lasted y• Englisshe pages toke the pylfre of the Scottes y• were slayn / euery man myght take without ony chalengynge of ony man. And so after this gracyous victory the kyng returned agayn vnto y• same syege of Barwik. And wham they y• were besyeged sawe & herde how kyng Edward had sped / they yelded to hym y• towne wt the castell on the morowe nexte after saynt Margaretes day. And than the kynge ordeyned syr Edward Baylloll with other noble & worthy men to be kepers and gouernours of Scotlonde in his absence / and hymselfe returned agayne and came in to Englonde after this vyctory with moche ioye and worshyp.  And in the nexte yere folowyng that is for to saye / in the yere of the incarnacyon of our lorde Iesu Chryst. M .CCC. and .xxxiij. and of kynge Edwardes regne .vij. he went agayn in to Scotlonde in wynter tyme / at whiche  age the castell of K brygge in Scotlond for hym & for his men that were with hym he recouered and had agaynst the Scottes all at his owne wyll.  And in that same yere syr Edwarde Baylloll kynge of Scotlonde helde his parlyament in Scotlonde with many noble lordes of Englonde that were at that same parlyament / bycause of theyr londes and also lordshyppes that they had in the realme of Scotlonde / and helde all of the same Edwarde Baylloll.  And in the viij. yere of kynge Edwardes regne about the feest of saynt Iohn Baptyst   Edward Baylloll the very & true kyng of Scotlonde / as by herytage and right lyne / made his homage and feaute vnto kynge Edwarde of Englonde for the realme of Scotlo¯d at Newe castell vpon Tyne / in the presence of many worthy lordes and also of the comyns bothe of the realme of Englo¯de and also of Scotlonde. And anone after in the same yere kyng Edward of Englonde retryued of the duke of Britayn his homage for the erledome and lordshyp of  ychemond.  And so folowyng in the.  . yere of his regne after Mighe mas rode in to Scotlonde / and there was fast by sayne Iohannes towne almoost all the wynter tyme / & so he helde his Chrystmasse at y• castell of Rokesburgh. And in the same yere through out al Englo¯de about sayt Clementes tyde in wynter there arose   suche a spryngynge and wellynge vp of water / & also of flodes / bothe of the see & also of fresshe ryuers & sprynges / that y• see bankes / walles and costes brake vp that men / beestes & houses in many places & namely in lowe countrees violently & sodeynly were drowned / & fruytes dryuen awaye of the erth through contynuaunce & aboundaunce of waters of the see / euer more afterwarde were turned in to more saltnes and sournes of sauour.  The .x. yere of kyng Edwardes regne kynge Edward entred the Scottysshe see after mydsomer / & to many of the scottes he gaue batayle & ouercame them / & many he treated & bowed to his peas through his doughtynes. And after at Myghelmasse than next folowynge was the erle of Moryf taken at Edenburgh and brought in to Englonde and put in to pryson.  And in the monethes of Iune and Iuly than nexte folowyng in the .xj. yere of his regne was seen and appered in y• fyrmament a bemed sterre the whiche clerkes call stella Cometa / and that sterre was seen in dyuers partes of the fyrmament. Where after anone there folowed in Englonde good chepe & wonders grete plente of all chaffer vytayles and marchaundyse / and there agaynst honger / scarcete / myschefe / and nede of money. In so moche that a quarter of whete at London was solde for two shyllynges / and a good fatte oxe at a noble / and fyue good doue byrdes for a peny. In whiche yere dyed syr Iohn of Eltham erle of Cornewayle that was kynge Edwardes broder / and lyeth at Westmynster.  How kynge Edwarde made a duchy of the erledome of Cornewayle / and also of syxe other erles that were newe made / and of the fyrst chalenge of the kyngdome of Fraunce. IN the yere of our lorde. M .CCC. & .xxxvij. and the .xij. yere of kyng Edward / in the moneth of Marche / durynge the parlyament at Westmynster in lent tyme kyng Edward made of the erledome of Cornewayle a duchy / & let it call y• duchy of Cornewayle / the whiche duchy he gaue to Edwarde his fyrst sone / with the erledome of Chestre. And also kynge Edwarde made at the same tyme .vj. other erles / that is to saye / syr Henry erle of La¯casters sone erle of Leycestre / Willyam of Boghun erle of Northhamton / Willyam of Mountagu erle of Salisbury / Hugh of Awdell erle of Glocestre / Robert of Vfford erle of Suffolke and Willyam of Cliton erle of Huntyngton.  And in that same yere it was ordeyned in the same parlyament y• no man  shold  were no cloth that was wrought out of Englo¯de / as of cloth of golde ne of sylke or veluet or damaske or satyn baud kyn / ne none suche other / ne none wylde ware ne furres of beyonde y• see / but suche as myght spende an hondred pounde of rent by yere. But this ordynaumce and statute was but of lytel effect / for it was nothynge holden.  In the .xiij. yere of his regne kyng Edward went ouer the see in to Braba¯d with quene Philip his wyfe there beryng a childe at And w rp there he dwelled more than a yere for to treate with the duke of Braba¯d & other alyed vnto hym of the chalengynge of y• kyngdome of Fraumce to kynge Edward of Englonde by ryght & by herytage after the deth of Karoll the grete kynge of Fraunce broder germayn of quene Isabel kyng Edwardes moder / the whiche was holden & occupyed vnrightfully by Philip of Valoys y• emes sone of Karoll The whiche duke & all his in y• foresayd thy¯ges & all other longyng therto with all his men and goodes kynge Edward foumde redy vnto hym & made & behyght       in  o Eng   .  Than in the .xiiij.  des of his   to be at his      ter the   of  y. The kynges   &   as touthynge the kyngdome of Fraumce. For whiche nedes to be   asked y• fyfth party of al y•  ble goodes of Englonde & the     the .ix. shefe of euery corne. And all the  rdes of euery towne wh  such thynges shold be taxed & gadred   to y• kyng therof / & he h  & helde   at his owne  st & wyll. W  I shall knowlege the very trouth / the inner loue of y• people was   into hate / & y• comyn prayers in to   / for cause that y• comyn people were so strongly greued.  Also the foresayd   of Fraumce had gadred vnto h  a grete hoost & destroyed there in his partyes & kyngdom many of y• kynges frendes of Englo¯de wt townes &   wt many other of theyr lordshyps / & many  s / shapes & despytes dyd vnto y• quene. Wher fore whan kyng Edward herde this / he was strongly   &  ngred therwt / & sent dyuers lettes ouer see to y• quene & to other y• were his frendes in gladding them / & certyfyenge them y• he wolde he there hymselfe in all y•  aste y• he might. And anone after rester   he had sped of all thyges that hym neded to haue / he went ouer see agayn. Of whose coming the quene & all his frendes were wonders glad / & made moche toye. And all y• were his enemyes & helde agaynst him made his moche sorowe. In the same tyme the king through coumseyle of his true   & coumseyle of his lordes y• there were present with hym   y• kynge of   name / & toke   y• kynges armes of Frafice quartred wt the armes of Englonde /   commanded forth with his coyne of golde vnder descripcyon &  yng of the name of Englonde & of Fraumce to be made best y• myght be / & y• is to saye / the floreyn y• was called y• noble pryce of. v . shyllynges .viij. pens sterlyng / & y• halfe noble y• value .iij. shyllynges &   . peus & the farthynge of y• value of   . peus.  How kynge Edwarde came vnto the Scluys and dyscomfyted all the power of Fraunce in the hauen. ANd in y• nexte yere after / that is to saye / the .xv. yere of his  egne he commaumded & let wryte in his chartres wryttes & other lettres the date of the regne of Fraumce y• fyrst. And whyle that he was thus doynge &  rauaylynge   Fraunce through his coumseyle  e wrote to al the prelates / dukes / cries & barons & the noble lordes of y• coumtre / & also to dyuers of the comyn people dyuers l s & maundementes berynge date at Gandaue the .viij. daye of February. And anone after within a lytell tyme he came agayn in to Englonde wt the quene & her children. And in y• same yere on midsomer euen he began to sayle toward Fraumce as gayn / & manly & fyersly he fell vpon Philyp of  aloys / the whiche longe tyme laye & had gadred to hym a full grete & boustous meyny of dyuers nacions in y• hauen of Scluys: & there they fought to gyder y• kyng of Fraumce & he with theyr  o es fro myddaye to thre of y• clocke on the morowe / in y• whiche batayle were slayne .xxx. M. men of y• kynges company of Fraumce / and many shyppes & cogges were taken. And so through goddes   he had there y• victory / & bare theus a gloryous  heualry. And in y• same yere   about saynt Iames tyme wold y• gates of saynt Diners Roberte of A theys   men of ing de & fla  egerly fought agaynst y• duke of Blitgoyn & y• frensshe men at whiche batayle were slayne & taken of the Frensshmen .xv. barons .lxxx. knyghtes / & shyppes & barkes were taken vnto y• nonbre of .CC. & .xxx. The same yere y• kyng makyng & abydyng vpon y• syege of Turney ye erle of Henaud wt englisshe archers made assaut vnto ye towne of saynt Amand / where as they slewe .l. knightes & many other / & also destroyed the towne.  And in the .xvj. yere of his regne folowynge in y• wynter tyme the king dwelled styll vpon y• foresayd syege & sent ofte tyme in to Englonde vnto his tresourer & other purueyours for gold & money yt shold be sent to hym in his nede but his proctours & messengers cursedly & full slowly serued hym at his nede & deceyued him / on whose defaut & laches the king toke trewse bytwene hym & the kyng of Fraumce. And than kyng Edward full of sorowe & shame in his hert withdrewe hym fro y• syege & came in to Bry tayn / & there was so grete stryfe for vytayle yt he lost many of his men / & whan he had done there yt he came fore he dressed hym ouer see in to Englonde. And as he sayled toward Englo¯de in y• hygh se  the most myshappes stormes & tempestes thonder & lyghtnynge fell to hym in the see / the whiche was sayd yt it was done & reysed through euyl spirytes made by sorcery & nygromancy of them of fraumte Wherfore y• kynges hert was full of soro we & anguysshe wellyng & syghynge & sayd vnto our lady in this wyse. O blyssed lady saynt Mary what is y• cause y• euer more goynge in to Fraumce all thynges & wethers fall to me ioyful & lyking as I wolde haue them / but alway turnynge in to Englo¯de all thynges fall vn profitable & very harmeful / neuertheles he stopyng an   of the s  worde came to the¯   of   styght.  And ye same yere y• kyng wolde his Chryst e at M s   word to y• Scottes   yt he was tidy & wold fyght wt   but the Scottes wold not  hyde / but fledde ouer y• scottysshe   them as   as they myght. And  che .xvij. yere of his regne about y• fe  of y• co¯ue syon of saynt Pauleking Edward wham he has ben in Scotlonde & sawe yt the Scottes were fled   came agayn in to Englonde. And a ytel before  ent was y• whiche tur neyment came al the yonge bachelary & cheualty of Englonde  many other  rles &   at the   turneyment kyng Edward hymselfe was there present.  And in y• .xviij. yere of his regne at his parlyamint holde¯ at Westmynster the auy zeme of  ester Edward y• thyrd made Edward his fyrst sone prynce of Wales.  And in y• .xix. yere of his regne and  afterin Ia y before lent king Edward let make ful noble Iustes & grete feestes in ye place of his byrth at Wyndsore / that these was neuer none suche seen there afore. At whiche feest & royalte were two kinges & two quenes the prynce of Wales / the duke of Eornewayle .x. erles .ix. coumtesses / barous and many burgeyses the whiche might not lyghtly be nombred / and of dyuers londes beyonde the see were many straungers. And at the same tyme whan the Iustes were done kyng Edward made a grete souyer / in the whiche he ordeyned & began his roumde table / & ordeyned and stedfasted the daye of the rounde cable to be holden there at wyndsore in the whytsonweke euer more yerely. And in this tyme Englysshnten so moche haunted and cleued to the woodnes & foly of the straumgers / that from tyme of comynge   of y• Hen es .xviij. yere passed they ordeyned & chaumged them euery yere dyuers shappes & disguisynges of clothy¯g oflonge large & wyde clothes destitute & deserte from all olde honeste & good vsage. And an othertyme short clothes & strayt wasted iagged & kyt / & on euery syde slatered & botoned with sleues & tapytes of surcotes / & hodes ouer longe & ouer moche hangyng yt yf I the sothe shall saye they were more lyke to turmentours & de uyls in theyr clothing & shoynge & other araye / than to men. And y• women more nycely yet passed the men in araye & curiouslyer / for they were so strayt clothed that they let hange foxe tayles sewed by uethe wtin theyr clothes for to hele & hide theyr arses / the whiche disguisynges & pryde perauenture afterwarde brought forth & raused many myshappes & myschefe in y• realme of Englo¯de.  The .xx. yere of kyng Edward he went ouer in to Brytayn & Gascoyn / in whose company went y• erle of warwyk / the erle of Suffolk / the erle of Huntyngton / & the erle of Arundell / & many other lordes & comyn people in a grete multytude / with a grete nauy of .CC. and .xl. shyppes / anone after mydsomer for to auenge hy¯ of many wronges & harmes to hym done by Phylyp of Valoys kynge of Fraunce agaynst y• trewse before hande graunted / the whiche trewse he falsly and vntruly by cauellacyons losed & disquatte.  How kynge Edwarde sayled in to Normandy / & arryued at Hogges with a grete hoost. IN the .xxi. yere of his regne kyng Edward through coumseyle of all y• grete lordes of Englonde called & gadred togyder in his parlyament at Westmynster before eester ordeyned hy¯ for to passe ouer y• see agayn for to disease & destrouble the rebelles of Fraumce. And wham his nauy was come togyder & made redy he went wt a grete hoost the .xij. daye of Iuly & sailed in to Normandy / & arryued at Hogges. And whan he had rested hym there .vj. days for bycause of trauayling of the see / & for to haue out all his men wt al theyr necessaries out of theyr shyppes he went towarde Cadomum brennynge / wastynge & destroyenge all y• townes yt he foumde in his waye. And the .xxvj. day of Iuly at y• brydge of Cadony manly & nobly strengthed & defended with Normans he had there a stronge batayle & a longe durynge / through whiche a grete multytude of people were slayne. And there were taken of prisoners the erle of Ewe / the lord Tankeruyll / and an .C. of other knightes & men of armes / &. vj .C. fote men nonbred / & the towne & yt subbarbes vnto y• bare wall of all thynge that they myght bere & cary out was robbed & despoyled. After y• king passed forth by the coumtre about the brede of .xx. myle be wasted all maner thynge that he foumde. Whan Philip of Valois perceyued this all though he were fast by hym with a stronge hoost / yet he  wold  not come nye hym / but brake all ye brydges beyonde ye water of Seyn fro Roen to Parys / & by¯ selfe fledde vnto ye same cite of Parys to all ye haste yt he myght. For sothe ye noble kyng Edward whan be came to Parys brydge & foumde it broken / wtin two dayes he let make it agayne. And on y• morowe after the Assumpcion of our lady kynge Edwarde passed ouer y• water of Seyn goynge to warde the water of Cres y / & destroyed by y• waye townes wt the people owenynge therin. And in the feest of saynt Barthylmewe he passed ouer the water of Somme vnhurte wt all his hoost there as neuer before had be¯ ony maner waye ne passage / where two. M. were slayne of them that letted theyr passage ouer. Therfore the .xxvj. daye of August   kynge Edward in a felde fast by Cres y hauynge thre batayles of Englysshmen encountred & mette wt Philip of Valoys hauyng wt him .iiij. batayles / of whiche the leest passed gretly ye nombre of Englysshe people. And wham these two hostes mette togyder / there fell vpon hym the king of Beme / ye duke of Loreyn / & erles also of Flaumdres / Dalaumson / Blois / Har court / Aumarle and Neuers / and many other erles / barons / lordes / knyghtes & men of armes the nombre of a. M .v .C. xlij. wtout fote men & other men armed yt were nothynge rekened. And for al this the vngloryous Philip wtdrew hy¯ wt the resydue of his people. Wherfore it was sayd in comyn amonge his owne people Nr¯e bel soy retreit / yt is to saye / our fayr wtdraweth hym. Than kynge Edward & our englisshmen thanked god of suche a victory after theyr grete labour taken to them all thynge nedeful to theyr suste naumce & sauynge of theyr lyues / and for drede of theyr enemyes rested the¯ there. And full erly in the mornynge after the frensshmen wt a grete hoost came agayn for to gyue batayle & fyght with y• englysshmen / with whome mette & encountred the erle of warwik / Northamton & Northfolke with theyr company / & slewe ij. M. and toke many prisoners of ye gentils of them / & the remenaumt of the same hoost fled .iij. myle thens. And the thyrd daye after ye batayle ye kyng went to Ca lays warde destroyenge all y• townes as he rode thyder. Whan he was comen / yt is to saye / the thyrde daye of September he began to besyege y• towne wt the castel & continued his syege fro y• foresaid thyrd day of September to y• thyrde day of August y• next yere after. And in y• same yere duryng y• syege of Calays y• kyng of scot londe with a grete multytude of scottes came in to Englond to Nouiles crosse about saynt Lukes daye the euangelyst / hopyng & trustyng for to haue foumde all the londe best ytute and voyde of people / for as moche as the kynge of Engloude was beyonde ye see / saue ouely preeste  & men of holy chirche & women & children and plowmen & suche otherlabourers / & there they came & robbed & dyd moche preuy sorow / but yet foumde they ynough that wtstode them by ye grate of almyghty god. And so a daye of bacayle was assygned bytwene them & certaynelordes & men of holy chirche yt were of ye coumtres with other comyn people fast by the cite of Durham / at whiche daye through ye grace of almyghty god y• Scottes were ouercomen / & yet were there thre tymes so many of them as of the englysshmen. And there was slayne all the cheualry & knyghthode of the realme of Scotlonde And there was taken as they wolde haue fled thens Dauyd the kyng of Scotlonde hymselfe / & the erle of Mentyf / syr William Douglas / & many other grete men of Scotlonde. And after yt our Englysshmen whan they had rested them a fewe dayes & had ordeined theyr kepers of y• north coumtree / they came to London & brought with them syr Dauid ye kyng of Scotlonde & all ye other lordes yt were taken prysoners vnto ye toure of London with all the haste yt they myght / & lefte them there in safe kepyng vnto the kynges comynge / & went home agayn in to theyr owne coumtre. And afterward was the kynges raumsom of Scotlonde taxed to an hondred thousand marke of syluer to be payed within .x. yere / yt is to saye / euery yere .x. thousande marke.  How kynge Edwarde besyege  Calays / and how it was wonne & yelded vnto hym. IN the .xxij. yere of y• regne of king Edwarde he went ouer the see in   the wynter tyme / & laye all the wynter at the syege of Calays / the whiche yere whyle y• syege lasted & endured / Philyp the kyng of Fraumce cast & purposed tray toursly & wt fraude to put away y• syege / & came the .xxvij. day of Iuly in y• same yere wt a grete hoost & a stronge power & nighed to y• syege of Calays / the whiche Philip the last day of Iuly sent to kyng Edward worde that he wold gyue hym playne batayle y• thyrde daye after that about euensonge tyme / yf he durst come fro y• syege & abyde. And whan kyng Edward herde that / without ony longe taryenge or longe auysement accepted gladly y• day & houre of batayle yt Philip had assygned. And whan ye kynge of Fraumce herde yt / the nexte nyght after he set his tentes a fyre & remeued & wente awaye cowardly. Than they yt were in ye towne & in ye castel besyeged seynge al this how that they had none other helpe ne socour of the king of Fraumce ne of his men / & also yt theyr vitayles wtin them were spended & wasted / & for faute of vitayles & re fresshing they ete horses / houmdes / cattes & myce for to kepe theyr treuth as longe as they myght / & wham they sawe & was foumde amonge them at ye last yt they had no thynge amo¯ge them for to ete ne lyue by / ne no socour nor rescowe of ye frensshe men of yt other syde / they wyst well that they must nedes dye for defaute / or elles yelde y• towne / & anone they went & toke downe y• baners & y• armes of Fraumce on euery syde yt were hangen out / & wente on the walles of ye towne in dyuers places as naked as they were borne / saue onely theyr shertes & their preuy clothes & helde theyr swerdes naked & the poynt downward in theyr ha¯des / & put ropes & halters aboute theyr neckes / & yelded vp the keys of ye towne & of the castell to kyng Edward of Englonde with grete fere and drede of herte. And whan kyng Edward sawe this / as a merciable king and lorde receyued them all to grace / & a fewe of the gretest persones of estate & of gouernaunce of the towne he sente in to Englonde there to abyde theyr raunsom & the kynges grace. And all y• comynalte of the towne the kynge let go whyther they wolde in peas & wtout ony harme / and let them bere with them all theyr thynges that they myght bere and cary awaye / kepynge the towne & the castell to hymselfe. Than through medracion of cardinals that were sent from y• pope trewse was taken there bytwene Fraumce & Englonde for .ix. monethes than nexte folowynge. And aboute Myg elmasse kyng Edward came agayne in to Englond with a gloryous victory.  And in the .xxiij. yere of his regne in y•  est partyes of the worlde there began a pas ylence and deth of sarasyns & pay  that so grete a deth was neuer herde of afore / & that wasted away the people so that vnneth the tenth persone was lefte alyue.  And in the same yere aboute y• south coumtrees there fell so moche rayne & so grete waters / that from Chrystinasse vnto mydsomer there was   daye nor nyght but that it rayned somwhat / through whiche waters y• pesty lence was so enfected & so  aboundaunt in all coumtrees / & namely about y• courte of Rome & other places & see costes that vnneth there were lefte lyuyng folke for to bury them honestly yt were deed. But made grete diches & pyttes yt were wonders brode & depe / & therin buryed them & made a renge of deed bodyes & cast aly tell erth to couer them aboue / & than cast in an other renge of deed bodyes / and an other renge aboue them. And thus were they buryed & none other wyse / but yf it were so yt they were men of grete estate so that they were buryed as honestly as they myght.  And after all this in the   xxiiij. yere of kynge Edwardes regne it was done him to wyte of a treason that was begon at Calays & ordeyned to sell that towne for a grete somme of florens to kynge Philip of Fraumce / through the falsnes & ordynaumce of a knyght y• was called syr Geffrey of Cheruey that was wonders preuy wt kyng Philip of Fraumce And Wham kyng Edward herde this / he toke wt hym y• noblest & gentyllest lordes & many other worthy men of armes that were present wt him for y• solempnite of y• hygh feest. And well & wysely in all the haste that he myght & as pryuely as he myght he went ouer the see to Calays. And y• same yere y• good kynge Edward helde his Chrystmasse at Hauerynge / & the morow after newe yeres day y• kyng was in y• castell of Calays wt his men of armes y• none of the alyens wyst therof. And y• fals co¯spyratour & traytour Geffrey of Cherney syth that he myght not openly haue his purpose of y• castell / pry uely & stelingly he came & helde y• towne with a grete hoost. And whan he wt his men were comen / he payed the foresayd somme of florens as couenaumt was to a Genewey in y• towne y• was keper of the castell & consentyng to the same Geffrey in all this falsnes & trechery / & boumde y• Englysshe mynstrels & seruauntes that were in y• castell y• they myght not helpe themselfe ne let them of theyr purpose. And than wenynge y• they had ben sure ynough / they spake al theyr wickednes & falsnes openly on hygh y• al men might here. And now shall ye here how they were deceyued / for they came in by a preuy posterne ouer a lytell brydge of tree / & whan they were comen in subtylly & priuely y• brydge was drawen vp & kepte y• none of them y• came in might go out / neno moo come in to them. And anone our Englysshe men went out at preuy holes and wyndowes & ouer the walles of the towne & of y• castel & went & faught manly with y• frensshmen y• were without / & had y• better of them / the whiche whan they were occupyed by the¯selfe on theyr syde / the kyng y• was within the towne hauynge wt hym scarsly but .xxx. men of armes drewe out his swerde & wt a loude voyce he cryed on hye. A saynt Edward A saynt George. And whan the people herde that / they came re¯nynge to hym & gaue to theyr enemyes so grete assaute that there were moo than. iij .C. men of armes & many moo other slayn / & many fled awaye. And so by y• grace of god the victory fell to y• Englysshmen. Than the kynge toke wt hym this Geffrey y• was fynder of this treason & also many other Frensshe prisoners / & within a whyle after he came agayne in to Englonde. And in this same yere & in the yere afore / & in the yere nexte folowynge was so grete a pestylence of men from the eest in to the west / & namely through botches / y• they that sekened as on this daye dyed on the thyrde daye after / to y• whiche men y• so dyed in this pestylence had but lytell respyte of theyr lyggy¯ge. Than pope Clement of his goodnes & grace gaue them full remyssyon & forgyuenes of all theyr synnes that they were shryuen of / & this pestylence lasted in London fro Mighelmasse vnto August nexte folowynge / almoost an hole yere. And in these dayes was deth without sorowe / weddynges without frendshyp / wylfull penaumce / & derth without scarsete / & fleynge wtout refute or socour / for many fledde from place to place bycause of the pestylence / but they were enfected & might not escape y• deth / after that y• prophete Isaie sayth Who that fleeth fro the face of drede / he shall fall in to the dyche. And he y• wyndeth hym out of y• dyche / he shall be holden and tyed with a grenne. But whan this pestylence was cesed as god wolde   vnnethes y• tenth parte of y• people was left on lyue.  And in y• same yere began a wonders thy¯ge / that all y• were borne after y• pestylence had two cheketethe in theyr heed lesse than they had afore.  How kynge Edward had a grete batayle With Spanyardes in y• see fast by Wynchelsee. ANd in the .xxv. yere of his regne about saynt Johns daye in haruest in y• see fast by Winchelsee kyng Edwarde had a grete batayle with men of Spayne where y• theyr shyppes & nauy laye chayned togyder / that eyther they must fyght or be drowned. And so whan all our Worthy men of armes & of the see costes fast by winchelse & Romney were gadred togyder / & our nauy & shyppes all redy to the warre the Englysshmen mette manly & strongly with theyr enemyes tomynge fyersly agaynst them. And whan y• spaynysshe vessels & nauy were closed in all aboute / there myght men se stronge batayle on bothe sydes & longe durynge / in whiche batayle was but fewe that faught but they were pyteously hurte. And after y• batayle there were .xxiij. shyppes taken / & so the Englysshmen had the better. And in y• nexte yere folowynge of his regne / y• is to saye the .xxvi. yere the kyng through his coumseyle let ordeyn & make his newe money that is to saye / the peny / the grote value of .iiij. pens / & the halfe grote of .ij. pens but it was of lesse weyght than the olde sterlyng was by .v. shyllyng in y• pounde And in the .xxvii. yere of his regne was the grete derth of vytayles / the whiche was called y• dere somer. And the. xxviii yere of his regne in y• parlyament hoiden at westmy¯ster after eester syr Henry erle of Laucastre was made duke of Lancastre.  And in this yere was so grete a drought / y• from the moneth of Marche to the moneth of July there fel no rayne on the erth / wherfore all fruytes / sedes & herbes for y• moost part were lost in defaute / wherfore came so grete dysease of men & beestes & derth of vitayles in englonde / so y• this londe y• euer afore had be¯ plenteous had nede y• tyme to seke vitayles & refresshyng at other out yles & coumtrees.  And in y• .xxix. yere of kyng Edward it was accorded / graumted & sworne bytwene the kyng of Fraumce & kyng Edward of Englo¯de y• he shold haue agayn all his lo¯des & lordshyps y• longed to the duchy of Guyen of olde tyme / y• whiche had ben wtdrawen and wrong fully occupyed by diuers kynges of Fraumce before hand to haue & to holde to ky¯g Edward & to his heyres & successours for euermo re / frely / peasybly & in good qu ete vpon this couenaumt that the kyng of Englo¯de sholde leue of & relese all his ryght & day me that he had claymed of y• kingdom of Fraunce / & of the tytell y• he toke therof vpon whiche speche and couenaumtes is was sent to the courte of Rome on bothesydes of y• kynges / that y• foresayd couenaumt sholde be embulled / but god erdeyned better for y• kynges worshyp of Englonde / for what through fraude & deceyt of y• frensshmen / & what through lettyng of y• pope & of y• court of Rome y• foresayd couenaumtes were disquat & lefte of. And in the same yere y• kynge reuoked by his wyse and dyscrete coumseyle the staple of wolles out of Flaumdres in to Englo¯de wt al y• libertees fraumchises & free customes that longed therto / & ordeyned it in Englo¯de in dyuers places / that is to saye at Westminster / Caumterbury / Chichestre / Brystow / Lyncolne & Null With all the foresayd thynges y• longe therto. And y• this thy¯ge y•  shold  thus be done y• kyng swore hy¯selfe therto / & prynce Edward his sone / wt other many grete witnesses y• there were pmsent.  And y• .xxx. yete of   his regne anone after whytsontyde in y• parlyament ordeyned at Westmynster it was tolde & certifyed to y• kyng y• Philip that helde the kyngdom of Fraumce was deed / & that John his sone was crowned king / & that this John had gyue¯ karoll his sone y• duchy of Guyen / of y• whiche thy¯ge whan kyng Edward wyst therof he had grete indignacion to hym & was wonders wroth & strongly meued. And therfore afore al y• worthy lordes y• were there assembled at y• parliament he called Edward his sone vnto hym / to whom y• duchy of Guyen by right herytage shold longe to / & gaue it hy¯ there / byddynge & strengthyng hym y• he sholde ordeyn hy¯ for to defend hym / & auenge hym on his enemyes / & saue & maynteyn his ryght And afterward kyng Edward hymselfe & his eldest sone Edward went to diuers places & sayntes in Englond on pylgrymage for to haue y• more helpe & grace of god & of his sayntes. And y• seconde kae. of July whan all thynge was redy to y• viage & batayl / & al his retynue & power assembled / & his nauy also redy / he toke with hym y• erle of Warwyk / the erle of Suffolk / the erle of Salysbury / & y• erle of Oxford / and a.

And whan he was arry ued in Guyen / he was there worshypfully receyued of the moost noble men & lordes of y• coumtre. And anone after kyng Edward toke wt him his two sones / y• is to saye / syr Leonell erle of Vlton / and syr John his broder erle of Rychemonde / & syr Henry duke of Lancastre / with many erles & lordes & men of armes / & two M. archers / & sayled towarde Fraumce / & rested hym a whyle at Calays / & afterwarde the kyng went wt his folke afore said & wt other soudyours of beyonde the see that there abode y• kynges comynge the seconde day of Nouember & toke his iourney toward kynge John of Fraumce there as he had trowed to haue founde hym fast by Ddomarum as his lettres & couenaumt made mencyon that he wolde abyde hym there wt his hoost. And whamkyng John of Fraumce herd tell of the comynge of y• kyng of Englonde / he went away wt his men & caryage cowardly & shamefully fleynge & wastynge all vytayles y• englysshmen shold not haue ther of. Whan kynge Edward herde tell y• he fled / he pursued hym wt all his hoost tyll Hedyn / & than he beholdynge y• scarsete & wantynge of vitayles & also y• cowardyse of the kynge of Fraumce / he returned agayn wastynge all the coumtree.  And whyle all these thynges were a doynge the Scottes pryucly & by night toke the towne of Barwyck / sleynge them that with stode them & no man els / but blyssed be god the castell was saued & kepte by englysshmen y• were therin. Whan y• kyng wyst of al this / he returned agayn in to Englo¯d as wroth as he myght be / wherfore in y• parlyament at Westmynster was graumted to the kynge of euery sacke of wolle .l. shyllynges durynge the terme of .vi. yere / y• he myght y• myghte lyer fyght & defende the realme agaynst the Scottes & other mysdoers. And so whan all thynges were redy the kynge hasted hym towarde the syege.  How kynge Edwarde was crowned kyng of Scotlo¯de / & how pry¯ce Edward toke y• kynge of Fraumce & syr Philyp his yonger sone at the batayle of Poytiers. ANd in the .xxxi. yere of his regne the .xiii. daye Janyuer the king beynge in the castell of Barwyk with a fewe men / but he hauynge there fast by a grete hoost and a goodly / the towne was yelden vnto hym without ony maner   defence of   an the kyng of Scotlande / y• is to say syr Iohn Ba  loll cosydecynge how y• go  dyd many me uayles & gracyous thynges for kyng Edward at his own wyll fro day to day he toke gaue vp y• realme of Scotlond at kilburgh in the kynges handes of Englond vnder his paten  lettres there madt. And anone after king Edward in presence of all y• prelates & worthy men y• were there letcrowne by kyng of Scotlond. Whan all thyges were done & ordeyned my¯ coumire at his wyll / he returned agayn in to Englonde wt a grete worshyp. And whyle this v age was a doynge in Scottonde syr Edward pry¯ce of wales as a man enspiced of god was in Guyen in y• cite of Burdeux tretyng & speking of y• chalenge of y• kynges right of Englo¯de y• he had to y• realme of Fraumce / & that he wold be auestged wt stronge hande / & y• prelates peres & mighty men of y• coumtree consented well to hym. Than syr Edward y• prynce with a grete h  gadred to hy¯ the .vj. daye of Jui y• went from Burdeux goynge & trauaylyng by many dyuers coumtrees / & he  oke many prysoners moo than .vj. thosande men of armes by y• coumtre as he went / & toke the towne of Remorant in Saloygne and desyeged the castell. vj dayes / & at y• vj. dayes ende they yelded y• castell vnto hym.

And many that were taken prysoners were set at theyr tausom & vpon theyr trouth and knyghthode were charged and had leue to go. But y• prynce toke with hym the kyng of Fraumce and Philip his sone with all the reuerence that he myght / & went agayne to Burdeux wt a gloryous vyctory.

And whan they had thus sworne / they toke theyr crosses y• theyr othes were compre he ded in to y• notaryes. And this same yere it fort  vpon the A ce¯cyon euen about mydday was seen y• eclypse of the   / & there folowed suche a drought / that for defaut of ayne there was grete br nnynge ofcor e fruyte &  .  And in the same moneth the .vj.   of Iune there fell a sanguyne rayn  almoost lyke blode at Burgoyne. And a sanguyne crosse from morow vnto pryme appered and was seen at Boloyn in the  yre / the   whiche many men sawe / & after it meued & fell in y• myddes of the see.  And in the same tyme in Fraumce & Englonde & many other londes as they that were in playne coumtrees & desert bare wytnes sodeynly there appered two castels / of y• whiche wente out two hostes of armed men. And that one hoost was clothed in whyte / & that other in blacke / & whan batayle bytwene them was begon / the whyte ouercame the blacke / & anone after the blacke toke herte to them & ouercame the whyte / & after that they went agayn i to theyr castels / & than y• castels & all the hoost vanysshed awaye.  And in the same yere there was a grete & an huge pestilence of people & namely of men whose wyues as women out of gouernaumce toke husba¯des as well straumgers as other lewde & symple people / y• whiche forgetynge theyr honour & worshyp & birth coupled & maried them wt them y• were of lowe degre & lytell reputacyon.  In this same yere died Henry duke of Lancastre / & also in this yere Edwarde prynce of Wales wedded the coumtesse of Kent y• was syr Thomas wyfe of Holand the whiche was departed somtyme & de uorced fro y• erle of Salysbury for cause of y• fals knyght. And about this tyme began & rose a grete company of diuers na cyons gadred togider / whose leders were Englysshmen wtout ony heed / y• whiche dyd moche harme in y• party of Fraumce. And not longe after there arose an other company of dyuers nacions / y• was called the whyte company y• which in y• partyes of Lombardy dyd moche sorowe.  The same yere syr Iohn of Gaunt the sone of king Edward y• thyrde was made duke of Lancastre by reason and cause of his wyfe that was the doughter & heyre of Henry somtyme duke of Lancastre.  Of the grete wynde / and how prynce Edwarde toke the lordshyp of Guyen of his fader / and went thyder. AAd in the .xxxvij. yere of kynge Edward the .xv. day of Ianyuer that is to saye / on saynt Mauryce daye about euensongtyme there arose & came suche a wynde out of y• south wt suche a fyersnes & strength that it brast & blewe downe to y• groumde high houses & stronge buyldynges / toures / chirches & steples & other stronge places / & all other stronge werkes y• stode styll were shaken therwt that they ben yet & shall euermore be the febler & weyker whyle they stande. And this wynde lasted wtout ony  ssyng. vu dayes continually. And anone after there folowed suche water in hey tyme & in y• haruest tyme that al felde werkes were gretly letted & left vndone.  And in the same yere prynce Edwarde toke y• lordshyp of Guyen / & dyd to kyng Edwarde his fader homage & fraute therof / & went ouer see in to Gascoyn with his wyfe & chyldren.  And anone after kynge Edward made syr Leonell his sone duke of Clarence / & syr Edmonde his other sone erle of Cambrydge.  And in y•. xxxvii . yere of his regne it was ordeyned in the parlyament that men of lawe bothe of y• chirche & te¯porall lawe sholde fro y• tyme forth plete in theyr moder tongue. And in y• same yere came in to Englonde thre kynges / y• is to saye / y• kyng of Fraumce y• kyng of Cypres / & y• kyng of Sectionde bycause to visyte & to speke wt the kynge of Englonde. And after they had be¯ here lo¯ge tyme / two of them went home in to theyr owne coumtrees & kyngdomes / but the kyng of Fraumce through grete sekenes & malady that he had abode styll in Englonde.  And in y• .xxxix. yere of his regne was a stronge & grete frost / & that lasted lo¯ge / that is to saye fro say  Andrewes tyde to the .xiiij. kal. of Apryll y•   the tylthe & sowynge of the erth & other suche felde werke & hande werkes were moche let & lefte vndone for colde & hardnes of y• erth. And at Drray in Brytayn was ordeyned a grete deedly batayle bytwene syr Iohn of Moumford duke of Britayn & syr Charles of Bloys / but y• victory fell to the foresayd syr Iohn through helpe & socour of y• englysshmen / & there were taken many knightes & squyers & other men y• were vnnombred / in y• whiche batayle was slayne Charles hy¯selfe with all y• stode about hym / & of y• Englysshmen were slayne but .vii.  And in this yere dyed at ye Sauoy Iohn y• king of Fraumce / whose seruyce and exequyes kynge Edwarde let ordeyn & dyd in dyuers places worshypfully to be done / & at Douer ordeyned hym worthely to be ledde wt his owne costes & expences / & fro thens he was fet in to Fraumce / & buryed at saynt Denys.  In y• .xl. yere of king Edwarde the .vij.  kal.  of Feueryer was borne Edward prynce Edwardes sone / the whiche wham he was .vii. yere of age dyed. And in the same yere it was ordeyned y• saint Peters pens fro y• tyme forth sholde not be payed / y• whiche kyng yuo somtyme kyng of Englo¯de of y• coumtre of westsaxons / y• began to regne the yere of our lord god .vi. C .lxxix. fyrst graumted to Rome for y• scole of Englonde there to be co¯tynued.  And in this same yere fel so moche rayne in hey tyme ye it wasted & destroyed bothe corne & hey. And there was suche debate and fyghtyng of sparowes by diuers places in these days / y• men foumde innumerable deed in y• feldes as they went. And there fell also suche a pestylence / y• neuer was seen suche in no mannes dayes y• than lyued / for men ye went to bedde hole and soumde / sodeynly they dyed.  Also ye tyme a sekenes that men call y• pockes slewe bothe men & women through theyr enfectyng.  And in the .xli. yere of king Edward was borne at Burdeux Rychard the seconde sone of prynce Edward of Englonde / y• whiche  Rychard  kynge Rycharde of Amorican heued at the fontstone / after whome he was called Rychard. And this same Rychard whan his fader was deed & kyng Edward also / he was crowned kyng of Englond the .xl. yere of his age through right lyne & herytage / & also by y• comyn assent & desyre of the comynalte of the realme.  Aboute this tyme at kyng Edwardes commaumdement of Englo¯de whan all the castels & townes were yelded to hym y• were holden in Fraumce by a grete company assembled togyder syr Bartram Claykyn a noble knyght & a good warryour went & purposed hy¯ to put Piers kynge of Spayne out of his kyngdome with helpe of y• moost party of y• foresaid grete company / trustynge also vpon helpe and fauour of y• pope / for as moche as it came to his ere y• the same Pyers sholde lede & vse a synfull lyfe / y• whiche Piers smytte¯ wt drede of these tydynges fledde in to Gascoyn to prynce Edwarde for to haue socour of hym. And whan he was fledde out of Spayne / Henry his broder that was a bastard by assent of y• moost partye of Spayne / & through helpe of y• ferefull company y• I spake of fyrst was crowned king of Spayne / & the nonbre of that same company was rekened and set at the nombre of .lx. M. fyghtynge men.  This same yere in y• moneth of Iune there came a grete company & a nauy of Danes / and gadred them togyder in the north see / purposyng to come in to Englonde to reue & robbe & also to slee with whome they encoumtred & mette in y• see. Maryners & other good fyghtyng men of the coumtre dysperpled them. And they ashamed went home agayne in to theyr owne coumtre / but amonge all other there was a buistous vessel & a stronge of theyr   nauy yt was ouersayled by the Englysshmen & was perysshed & drowned / in the whiche ye stewarde & other grete men of De¯marke were taken prisoners / & ye king of Englo¯de & his coumseyle prisoned them the whiche lordes ye Danes afterwarde came & sought all about for to haue had them agayn wt theyr goodes yt they had lost / & they not well ap yed ne pleased of the answere yt they had there / returned home wardes agayn / leuynge behynde them in theyr Innes pryuely wryten in scrowes and on walles. Yet shal Danes waste y• wanes. Than happed there an Englysshe wryter & wrote agaynst the Dane in this maner. Here shall Danes fette theyr banes.  This tyme Pyers kyng of Spayne wt other kinges / yt is to saye / the kyng of Nauerne & the kyng of Malog  beynge meanes went bytwene & prayed couseyle & helpe of syr Edward the prince / through whose coumseyle wham he had vnderstande theyr artycles & desyre yt he was required of ye kynges / loth he was & ashamed to saye nay & contrary them / but neuertheles he was agast lest it shold be ony preiudyce agaynst ye pope & longe tyme taryed them or yt he wolde graumt or consent therto / tyll he had better coumseyle & auysement wt good deliberacyon of kynge Edward his fader. But whan he was wt euery dayes & co¯tynuall besechyng of many noble men requyred and spoken to / & wt many prayers sent & made bytwene them. Than prynce Edwarde sent to his fader bothe by complaynyng lettres & also by comfortable co¯teynyng all theyr suggestions & causes wt all ye other kynges epystles & lettres for to haue comfort & helpe of ye wronges not onely done to ye kyng of Spayne but also for suche thynges as myght fall to other kynges Also yf it were not the sooner holpen & amended through ye dome & helpe of knight hode to them yt it as ed & desyred. The whiche lettre wham ye kyng & his coumseyle had seen suche a kynges spoylyng & robbyng wt moche meruayle / & sent agayne comfortable lettres to prynce Edward his sone & to ye other foresayd kynges / & warned them to arme & ordeyne the¯ agaynst that mysdoer / & to  stande them by the helpe of god that were suche enemyes to kynges. Whan this noble prynce had receyued these lettres hy¯selfe with ye other kynges before sayd all theyr coumseyle called togider or yt he wold vndertake ye quarel / he b side & knytte fore ye kyng yt was deposed wt a grete othe / yt is to saye / yt he shold euer after maynteyn the ryght byleue & fayth of holy chirche / wt all theyr mynystres ryghtes & lybertees to defende from all theyr enemyes & all euyls / & al that were there agaynst bytterly to punysshe & destrouble / & all ye ryghtes libertees preuyleges of holy chirche encreace & maynteyn / & amende all thynges yt be wrongfully taken   & borne away by hym or by other bycause of hym hastely to restore agayn / & to dryue & put out s syns & all other   people out of his kyngdom wt al his strength & power / & suffre   admytte none suche for no maner thy¯ge ne cause to dwel therin   nd yt whan he had taken a chris  woman he  shold  neuer come in to none other womans bedd  / ne none other mannes wyfe to defoule. All these foresayd thynges truly to kepe co¯tynue & fulfyll as all his lyftyme he was boumde by othe afore   / in pres nce & wytnes of those kynges wt other dry e s. And than that gracyous prince Edwarde vndertoke ye cause & the quarel of ye kyng yt was deposed / & behyght hym with the grace of almighty god to restore hym agayn to his kyngdome / & let ordeyn & gadre togyder forthwt in all haste his nauy wt men of armes for to warre & fyght in his foresaid cause.  And in this tyme vpon sand of   the scottes see that many a man it sawe thre dayes togyder there were seen two Egles / of the whiche y• one came out of y• south / & y• other out of y• north / & cruelly & strongly they fought & wrastled togyder / & the south Egle fyrst ouercame the north Egle & al to rent hym wt his byll & his clawes that he  shold  not rest ne take no breth. And after the south Egle slewe home to his own costes. And anone after there folowed & was seen on the morowe afore y• sonne rysyng & after in y• last day of October saue one daye many sterres gadred togyder on a epe fell down to y• erth / leuynge behynde them fyry bemes in maner of lightnynge / whose flambes brent & consumed mennes clothes & mennes heere walkyng on y• erth as it was seen & knowen of many a ma¯. And yet y• northeren wynde y• is euer redy & destynate to all yll fro saynt Katherynes euen tyll .iij. dayes after lost grete good wtout nonbre vnrecouerable. And i y• same days there fell & came also suche lyghtnynge thonder / snowe & hayle / that it wasted & destroyed men / beestes / houses & trees.  Of the batayle of Spayne besyde the water of Nazers ye was bytwene prince Edward & syr Henry bastard of spayne. IN the yere of our lord a. M. CCC lxvij. & of kynge Edward .xlij. the thyrde day of Apryll there was a stronge batayle & a grete in a large felde called Priazers fast by the water of Nazers in Spayne bytwene syr Edward y• prynce & syr Henry of Spayne / but the vyctory fell to prynce Edward by y• grate of god. And this same prynce Edwarde had wt hym syr Iohn duke of La¯castre his broder / and other worthy men of armes about the nombre of .xxx. M. And y• kyng of Spayne had on his syde men of dyuers nacyons to y• nombre of an hondred thousande & moo / wherfore the sharpenes and fyersnes of his aduersary with his full buystous & grete strength made and droue the ryghtfull party abacke a grete waye / but through y• grace of god almyghty passyng ony manes strength that grete hoost was disparpled myght fully by y• noble duke of Lancastre & his boost or that prince Edward came nygh hym. And whan Henry bastarde sawe that / he turned with his men in so grete haste & strength to flee / that a grete company of them in the foresayd flode and of the brydge therof fell downe and perysshed. And also there were taken the erle of Dene and syr Bartram Cleykyn that was chefe maker & causer of the warre and also cheftayne of the vauntward of the batayle with many other grete lordes and knyghtes to the nombre of two thousande / of whome two hondred were of Fraumce / & many also of Scotlo¯de. And there were felled in the felde on our enemyes syde of lordes and knyghtes with other people to the nombre of vi. M. and moo / and of Englysshe men but a fewe. And after this y• noble prynce Edwarde restored y• same Pyers to his kyngdom agayne / the whiche Pyers afterwarde through trechery & falsnes of y• foresayd bastard of spayne as he sate at his meet he was strangled & dyed. But after this vyctory many noble and hardy men of Englonde in Spayne through the fluxe and dyuers other sekenesses toke theyr deth.  And also in the same yere in the Marche was seen stella cometa bitwene the north costes and the west / whose bemes stretched toward Fraumce.  And in the nexte yere folowynge of kynge Edwardes regne .xliii. in Apryl syr Leonel kyng Edwardes sone that was duke of Clarence went toward Myleyn with a chosen meyny of y• gentyls of Englonde for to wedde Galois doughter and haue   her to his wyfe / by whom he shold haue halfe y• lordshyp of Myleyn. But after y• they were solemply wedded / & aboute y• natiuite of our lady y• same duke of Myleyn dyed. And in y• same yere y• frensshe men brake y• peas & trewse rydyng on y• kynges groumde & lordshyp of Englonde in the shyre & coumtre of Poumtyfe / & toke & helde castels & townes: & bare y• englyssh men on honde falsly & subtylly that they were cause of brekyng of y• trewse. And in this yere dyed y• duchesse of La¯castre / and is buryed in saynt Paules chirche.  The .xliiii. yere of y• regne of kyng Edward was the gretest pestylence of men & of grete beestes / & by y• grete fallyng of waters y• fell at y• tyme / there fell grete hyndrynge & destroyenge of corne / in so moche y• the nexte yere after a busshell of whete was solde for .xl. pens. And in the same yere about y• last ende of Maye the king held his parliament at Westminstre in whiche parliament was spoken of the othe & trewse y• was broken bytwene hy¯ & the kynge of Fraumce / & how he myght best be auenged vpon his wronge. In y• same yere on y• Assumpcyon of our lady dyed quene Philip of englo¯de a ful noble lady & a good woman / & at westmynster worshipfully is buryed. And about myd somer the duke of Lancastre & the erle of Herford wt a grete company of knightes went in to Fraumce where they gate them but lytel worship / for there was a grete hoost of the Frensshmen vpon Calkhull brydge / & an other hoost of englysshmen fast by y• same brydge y• longe tyme had lyued there / & many worthy & grete men of the englysshmen ordeyned & gaue coumseyle for to fight and gyue batayle to the frensshmen / but y• foresayd lordes  wold  not consent therto for no maner thynge.  Anone after it happed that the erle of warwik came thyderward for to warre And whan y• frensshmen herde of his coming / or that he came fully to londe they left theyr tentes   pauylyons wt at theyr vitayles & fled pryuely away. And wham the erle was comen to londe wt his men he went in all haste toward Normandy & destroyed y• yle of Caux wt strengthe of swerde & through fyre. But alas in his returnynge to Englond agayn at Calays he was taken wt sekenes of pest   & dyed / not leuyng behynde him after his dayes so noble a knyght of armes. In whiche tyme regned & warred the noble knyght syr Iohn Hawkewod y• was an englysshman borne / hauynge wt hym at his gouernaunce y• whyte company afore sayd / the whiche one tyme agaynst holy chirche / & an other tyme agaynst lordes warred & ordeyned grete batayles &   re in the same coumtre he dyd many meruaylous thy¯ges.  And aboute y•   syon of saynt Paule y• kyng wham  e had ended & done y• enterynge &   grete costes & rialtees about y• sepul  and buryenge of quene Philip his wyfe he helde a parliament at westmynster in whiche parliament was asked of y•   a thre yeres dyme / y• is to say / a g  me to be payed .iii. yere duryng. And the clergy put it of & wolde not graumt it vnto Ester next comyng / & than they graumted wel y• in .iii. yere by certayn termes that dyme sholde be payed / & also of y• lay   was a .iii. yeres .xv. graumted to y• kyng.  How syr Robert Knolles wt other certayne lordes of the realme went ouer se  in to Fraumce / & of theyr gouernaumce. ANd in the .xlv. yere of kyng Edward in y• begynnynge he w h vnwyse coumseyle & vndiscrete borowed a grete some of golde of y• prelates lordes / marchaumtes & other ryche men of his realme / sayenge y• it shold be spent in defendyng of holy chirche & of his realme. Neuertheles it pfyted no thynge / wherfore   about mydsomer after he made a grete hoost of the worthiest men of his realme amonge whome were some lordes / ye is to saye / the lorde Fitz water / & the lorde Graunson / & other worthy knyghtes / of whiche knightes the kyng ordeyned syr Robert Knolles a proued knyght & well assaied in dedes of armes for to be gouernour / and that through his coumseyle all thynge shold be gouerned & dressed. And wham they came in to Fraumce / as lo¯ge as they dwelled & helde them hole togyder the frensshmen durst not fall vpon them And at ye last about ye begy¯uynge of wynter for enuy & couetyse that was amo¯ge them & also discord / they sondred them & parted in to dyuers companyes vnwysely & folisshly. But syr Robert Knolles & his men went & kepte them safe wtin a castel in Brytayn. And whan the frensshmen sawe yt our men were deuyded in to dyuers companyes & places / not holdyng ne strengthyng them togider as they ought to do / they fell fyersly on our men / & for ye moost party toke them or slewe them / & those yt they myght take led wt them prysoners.  And in ye same yere pope  rban came fro Rome to Auinyon bycause that he shold accorde and make peas bytwene ye kynge of Fraumce & the kynge of Englonde for euermore. But alas or he began his treatyse he dyed wt sekenes ye xxj. day of December / & was buryed as for ye tyme in ye cathedral chirche of Auin yon fast by the hye awter. And the nexte yere after wham he had lyen so his bones were taken out of ye erth & buryed newe in ye abbey of saynt  ictory fast by Mar cile / of ye whiche abbey he was somtyme abbot hymself. And in bothe places yt he was buryed in there be many grete myracles done & wrought through ye grace of god to many a ma¯nes helpe & to ye worshyp of almyghty god.  After whome folowed next & was made pope Gregory cardynall deken / that before was called Piers Roger.  In this same yere ye cite of Lymoge rebelled & faught agaynst ye pryuce as other cytees dyd in Guyen for grete taxes / costages / & raumsoms yt they were put & set to by pry¯ce Edward / whiche charges were importable & chargeable / wherfore they turned fro hym & fel to ye kynge of Fraumce. And whan prynce Edward sawe this: he was sore chafed & greued / & in turnyng homeward agayn in to Englonde with sore scarmysshes & fyghtyng & grete assautes fought with them / & toke ye foresayd cite & destroyed it almoost to ye groumde / & slewe al that were foumde in ye cite. And than for to say ye sothe for dyuers sekenes & maladyes yt he had & also for defaute of money yt he myght not withstande ne tary on his enemyes he hyed hym agayn in to Englo¯de wt his wyfe & meyny / leuyng behynde hym in Gascoyn the duke of Lancastre & syr Edmond erle of Cambridge wt other worthy and noble men of armes.  In the .xlvj. yere of kyng Edward at the ordinaumce & sendyng of kynge Edward / the kyng of Nauerne came to hym to Claringdon to treate wt hym of certayne thynges touthynge his warre in Normandy / where kyng Edward had lefte certayn lyeges in his stedetyl he came agayn. But king Edward might not spede of that that he asked hym. And so ye kynge of Nauerne with grete worshyp & grete gyftes toke his leue & went home agayn.  And about the begynnynge of Marche whan the parliament at Westmynster was begon the¯ kynge asked of the clergy a subsydy of .l. M. pounde / ye whiche by a good auysement & by a generall conuocacyon of the clergy it was graumted & ordeyned that it  shold  be payed & reysed of the lay fee. And in this parlyament at ye request & askynge of the lordes in hatred of men of holy chirche / the chaunceler & the tresourer   that were bysshops / & the clerke of the preuy seale were remeued and put out of theyr offyce / & in theyr stede were seculer men put in. And whyle this parlyament lasted there came solempne embassatours fro ye pope to treate with the kynge of peas / & sayd yt the pope desyred to fulfyll his predecessours wyll / but for all theyr comynge they spedde not.  Of the besyegynge of Rochell / & how the erle of Penbroke & his company was there taken in ye hauen wt Spanyardes and all his shyppes brent. He .ix. daye of Iune kynge Edward in ye .xlvij. yere of his regne helde his parlyament at Wynchestre / & it lasted but .viij. dayes / to whiche parlyament were sompned by wryte of men of holy chirche .iiij. bysshops & .iiij. abbots wtout ony moo. This parlyament was holden for marchaumtes of London / of Nor wyche / and of other dyuers places in dyuers thy¯ges & poyntes of treason yt they were defamed of / yt is to saye / that they were rebell & wold aryse agaynst ye kyng  This same yere ye duke of La¯castre & the erle of Cambrydge his broder came out of Gascoyne in to Englonde / & toke & wedded to theyr wyues Peters doughters somtyme kyng of Spayne / of whiche two doughters ye duke had yt elder / & the erle ye yonger. And yt same time there were sent two cardynals fro ye pope / yt is to saye an Englysshe cardinall & a cardynall of Parys to treate of peas bytwene these two realmes / whiche whan they had ben bothe lo¯ge eche in his {pro}uynce & coumtrees fast by tretynge of the foresayd peas / at y• last they toke wt them ye lettres of procuracy & went agayne to Rome wtout ony effect of theyr purpose. In this yere there was a stronge batayle on ye see bytwene Englysshmen & Flemynges / & the Englisshmen had the victory / & toke xxv. shyppes wt salte / & s eynge & drownyng all ye men yt were therin vnwyting them yt they were of ye countree / & moche harme sholde haue fallen therof had not peas & accorde soone be made bytwene them.  This yere ye frensshmen besyeged ye towne of Rochell / wherfore ye erle of Penbroke was sent in to Gascoyn wt a grete company of men of armes for to destroye y¯ syege which passed ye see & came safe to ye hauen of Rochell / & whan they were there at ye hauens mouth or yt they myght entre / sodeynly came vpon them a stronge nauy of Spanyerdes whiche ouercame ye Englysshmen in moche blemysshynge / hurtyng & sleynge of many people / for as moche as ye Englysshmen were not than redy for to fyght ne warned of the¯. And as ye Spanyerdes came vpon them all the Englysshmen eyther they were taken or slayne / and. r. of them were sore wounded to the doth  & al the r shyppes brent / & there they toke ye erle wt a grete tresour of the realme of Eng  & many other noble men also on my  mer euen ye whiche is sa t Etheldredes day / & ledde them wt them in to Spayn  And of this myschefe was no grete w  der / for this erle was a full   l uer as an open lechour. And also in a certa e parlyament he stode & was agaynst the ryghtes & fraumchyses of holy chirche & also he coumseyled ye kynge & his co  that they shold aske more of men of holy chirche than other {per}sones of the lay fee. And for the kynge and other men of his counseyle accepted and toke rather euyll opynyons & causes agaynst men of holy chirche than he dyd for to defende and maynteyne the ryght of holy chirche,  t was after seen many tymes for lacke of fortune and grace they had not so grete victory ne power against theyr enemyes as they dyd before.  This same yere ye kyng wt a grete hoost entred the see to remeue   the syege of Rochell / but ye wynde was euer contrary to hym / & suffred hy¯ not longe tyme to go ferre fro the londe / wherfore he abode a certayn tyme vpon ye see costes abyding after a good wynde & yet came it not. So at the last he came thens wt his men to lonoward agayn / & anone as he was on lo¯de ye wy¯de turned & was in an other coste than it was afore.  How the duke of Lancastre wt a grete hoost wente in to Flaundres & passed by Parys through Burgoyn and through all Fraumce tyll he came to Burdeux. SOone after in the .xlviij. yere of ye regne of kyng Edward the duke of Lancastre wt a grete power went in to Flaumdres and passed by Parys through Burgoyn & through all Fraunce tyll he came to Burdeux wtout ony maner with standyng of ye frensshmen / & he did them but lytel harme / saue he toke & raumsoned many places & townes & many men: & after let them go frely.  The same yere ye kyng sent certayne embassatours to the pope / prayenge hym yt he  shold  leue of & not medle in his courte of the kepynges & reseruacyons of benefyces in Englo¯de & yt those yt were chosen to bysshops sees & dignitees frely & with full myght ioye & haue & be confermed to ye same of theyr metropolytans & archebisshops as they were wont to be of olde tyme. Of these poyntes & of other touchyng ye ky¯g & his realme / wham they had theyr answere of the pope / the pope enioyned them yt they  shold  certyfy hym agayn by theyr lettre of ye kynges wyll & of his realme or they determyned ought of ye foresayd articles  In this same yere dyed Iohn ye archebysshop of Yorke / Iohn bysshop of Ely / William bysshop of worcestre / in whose stedes folowed & were made bysshops by auctorite of ye pope / mayster Alexander Neuyll to the archebysshopryche of Yorke / Thomas of Arundell to the bysshopryche of Ely / & syr Henry wakefelde to ye bysshopryche of worcestre. In ye whiche tyme it was ordeyned in ye parlyament that all cathedrall chirches sholde ioye & haue theyr eleccyons hole / & that ye kyng fro yt tyme afterwarde sholde not wryte agaynst them yt were chosen / but rather helpe them by his lettres to theyr co¯fyrmacyon. This statute dyd moche {pro}fyte And in this parliament was graumted to the kynge a dyme of the clergy & a .xv. of lay fee.  In the .xlix. yere of kyng Edward dyed mayster Willyam wytlesey archebysshop of Caunterbury / and the monkes of ye same chirche asked & desyred a Cardynall of Englonde to be archebysshop / & therfore ye king was agreued & purposed to haue exiled ye monkes of ye same hous. And they spent moche good or they myght haue the kynges grace & his loue agayn / but yet wold ye king not consent to theyr eleccyon of ye cardinall / ne of ye pope also ne his cardynals.  And at ye begynnynge of August it was treated & spoken at Bruges of certayn poyntes & artycles hangyng bytwene ye pope & the kyng of Englonde / & this treatyse lasted almoost two yere. At yt last it was accorded bytwene them yt the pope fro ye tyme forth sholde not vse ne dele with ye reseruacyons of benefyces in Englonde and that ye kyng sholde not graumte ne let no benefyces by his wryte that is called Quare impedit. But as touchynge the eleccyon abouesayd there was no thy¯ge touched ne done. And that was wyted & put vpon certayne clerkes the whiche rather supposed & hoped to be auaunced and promoted to bysshopryches whiche they desyred & coueyted by the courte of Rome rather than by ony other eleccions.  This same yere about Candelmasse there mette togyder at Bruges many   noble & worthy men of bothe sydes & realmes to treate of peas bytwene the two kynges. And this treatyse lasted .ij. yere wt grete costes & large expenses of bothe partyes. And at ye last they went & departed thens wtout ony accord or effect. The nexte yere after the .l. yere of kynge Edward / the .iiij. non¯. of Maye beynge yet voyde & vacaunt ye archebysshopryche of Caumterbury mayster Symond sudbery bysshop of London was made archebysshop: & mayster William Courtney that was bisshop of Herford was than made bysshop of London / & ye bisshop of Bangor was made bysshop of Herford. And this same tyme in a certayne treatyse & spekyng of peas trewse was taken bytwene Englonde & Fraumce fro mydsomer to the nexte mydsomer after. And aboute ye begynnynge of Apryll ye duke of Brytayne wt many erles / barons & worthy lordes & men of Englonde went ouer see in to Britayne where he had all his lust / desyre & purpose ne had ye foresayd trewse ben so soone taken whiche letted them.  This same tyme ye yle of Constantyne where yt the castel of say¯t Sauyour is in / yt longe tyme was fought at / & besyeged of the frensshmen was than yolden to them wt all the appertenaumces / to grete harme & hyndrynge of ye realme of Englond. And this same yere there were so grete & so passyng betes & therwtall a grete pestylence in Englonde & in other dyuers partyes of the worlde yt it destroyed & sewe violently & strongly bothe men & women wtout nonbre.  This same yere dyed syr Edward y¯ lord spencer a worthy knight & a bolde / & in ye mynster of Teukesbury worshipfully is buryed. And lasty¯g this pestilence ye pope at ye instaunce & prayer of an englysshe Cardynall graumted to all people yt dyed in Englonde yt were sory & repentaumt for theyr synnes & also shryu  full remyssyon by two bulles vnder lede vj. monethes than next to last.  In this same yere ye erle of Penbroke was taken and raumsoned by B t am Claykyn bytwene Parys & Calays as he came toward Englond vpon saynt Etheldredes daye / the whiche saynt as it was said ye erle oftentymes had offended / & within a lytell whyle after he dyed. And in Noue¯ber nexte after there mette at Bruges the duke of Lancastre & ye duke of Angeo with many other lordes and prelates of bothe realmes for to treate of peas.  Of the deth of prynce Edwarde / & of the lord Latimer and dame Alyce Pe s through whom & her maynteyners the realme many a day was mysgouerned. NOt lo¯ge after the .lj. yere of kyng Edwardes regne he let ordeyn & holde at Westmynster the gretest parliament yt was seen many a yere afore. In the whiche parlyament he asked of the comynalte of ye realme as he had done afore a grete subsidy to be graumted to him for defendyng of hym & his realme. But the comyns answered ye they were so of  day by day greued & charged wt so many talages & subsidyes yt they might no longer suffre suche burthens & charges / & ye they knewe & wyst well ynough that ye kyng had ynough for sauynge of hym & his realme / yf ye realme were wel & truly gouerned / but ye it had ben so longe   gouerned by yll offyeers / that ye  ea me myght neyther be plenteous of chafer & marchaumdyse ne also wt rychesse. And in these thynges they profred themselfe / yf the kynge wolde certaynly to pre  and standeby. And yf it were foumde & preued afterwarde that ye kyng had nede / they wold gladly euery man after his power and state hym helpe and l ne. And after this were publysshed & shewed in ye parlyament many playntes and defa es of   dyuers officers of y• realme / & namely of the lorde Larimer the kynges chamberlayn bothe to y• kyng & oke to the realme And also at the last there was spoken & treated of dame Alyce Pers for the grete wro¯ges & euyll gouernaumce y• was done by her coumseyle in y• realme / the whiche dame Alyce Pers the kynge had holden longe tyme to his lemman / wherfore it was the lesse wonder though through y• fraylte of y• womans excityng & her sterynge he consented to her lewdnes & euyll coumseyle / the whiche dame Alyce & also y• lorde Larimer & other suche y• meued the kynge to euyll gouernaumce agaynst his profyte & the realme also / al y• comynalte asked & desyred y• they  shold  be remeued & put away / & in theyr stedes wyse men & worthy that were true & well assayed & proued / & of good gouernaumce  shold  be put in theyr stedes. So amonge al other there was one among the comyns that was a wyse knight & true & an eloquent ma¯ / whose name was Piers de la mare And this Piers was chosen to be spekee for the comyns in y• parlyament. And for this same Pyers tolde & publysshed the trouth & rehersed the wronges agaynst the foresayd dame Alyce & other certayn persones of y• ky¯ges coumseyle as he was bydden by the comyns / & also trustynge moche to be supported & maynteyned in this mater by helpe & fauour of y• prynce anone as y• prynce was deed / at the instaumce & request of y• foresaid dame Alyce this Piers de la mare was iudged to perpetuall prison in y• castel of Notyngham in y• whiche he was .ij. yere. And in y•. vj  kal.  of Iuly lastyng y• same parlyament dyed prynce Edward kyng Edwardes fyrst sone / y• is to saye / on trinite sondaye in worship of whiche feest he was wont euery yere where y• euer he were in the worlde to hold & make y• moost sole¯pnite that he myght / whose name & fortune of knyghthode (but yf it had be¯ of another Hector) all men bothe chrysten & hethen whyle y• he lyued & was in good poynt wondred moche & drad hy¯ wonders sore whose body is worshypfully buryed in Chrystchirche at Caumterbury.  And in this same yere y• men & y• erles tenaumtes of warwik arose malycyously agaynst y• abbot & coue¯t of Euesham & theyr tenaumces / & destroyed y• abbey & y• town / & wounded & bet theyr men & slewe many of them & went to theyr maner places & dyd moche harme / & brake downe theyr parkes & closes & slewe theyr wyld beestes & chaced them / brekyng theyr fyssh pondes he des / & let y• water of theyr pomdes stewes & ryuers ren out & toke y• fysshe & bare it wt them / & dyd them all y• sorowe y• they myght / so ferforth y• they had destroyed perpetually y• abbey wt al theyrmenbres & appertenaumces but yf the kyng y• sooner had not holp  it & taken hede therte / & therfore y• kyng sent his lettres to y• erle of warwik / chatgyng & commaumdyng hy¯ y• he sholde siynt redresse & amende those euyl boers & brekers of his peas / & so by meanes oflordes & other frendes y• peas was made bytwene them / & for this hur lyng as it was sayd y• kyng wold not be gouerned at y• time by his lordes y• there were in y• parliament / but he toke & made his sone the duke of La¯castre his gouernour of y• realme / the which stode so styll as gouernour tyll y• tyme that he dyed.  The same yere after Candelmas or y• parlyament was done the kyng asked a subsydy of y• clergy & of y• lay le / & it was graumted hym / y• is to say y• he shold haue of euery persone of y• lay le / bothe man & woman that passed .xiiij. yere of age. iiij pens / out take poore beggers that were knowen openly for nedy poore beggers. And that he  shold  haue of euery man of holy thirche y• was benefyced or promoted .xij. pens / & all other y• were not proted.   iiij. pens / out take the .iiij. ordres of the freres beggers.  This same yere after Mighelmasse Rychard prynce Edwardes sone was made pry¯ce of Wales to whome y• king gaue also the duchy of Cornewayle wt the erledome of Chestre. And aboute this tyme the Cardynall of Englonde the fourth daye before Mary Mawdeleyns daye after dyner sodeinly was stryken wt a palsey & lost his speche and on Mary Mawdeleyns daye dyed.  Of the deth of kyng Edward / & how syr Iohn Monsterwarth knyght was drawen and hanged for his falsnes. BYght anone after in the .lij. yere of kyng Edward in the begy¯nynge of October pompe Gregory y• .xj. brought and remeued his courte with hym from Auinyon to Rome.  And the .xij. day of Apryll Iohn Monsterwarth knyght at London was drawen & hanged & than quartred & sent to foure chefe townes of Englo¯de / & his heed smitten of & set vpon London brydge. For this Iohn was full vntrue to y• kyng & to the realme & couetous & vnstable / for he toke oftentymes grete so¯mes of money of the kyng & his counseyle for men of armes wages that he sholde haue payed them / & toke it to his owne vse / & he drad that at y• last he shold be shent & accused for y• same cause & fledde pryuely to y• kynge of Fraumce / & was sworne to hym & became his man and behyght hym a grete nauy out of Spayne to co¯fusyon and destroyenge of Englo¯de. But y• ryghtfull god to whom no preuite is vnknowen / suffred hy¯ first to be shent & spylte or y• he so traytoursly & falsly betrayed his lyege lord y• king of Englonde & his people in his realme / in the which groumde this same Iohn was borne / & wyckedly through batayle destroyed or he brought aboute his cursed purpose.  In y• feest of saynt Gregory nexte after kynge Edward gaue to Rycharde of Burdeux his heyre that was prynce Edwardes sone at Wyndsore the ordre of knyghthode & made hy¯ knyght / the whiche kyng Edward whan he had regned .lj. yere & more / y• .xj.  kal.  of Iune he dyed at Shene / & is buryed worshyp fully at westmy¯ster / on whose soule god haue mercy. This kyng Edward was forsothe of a passyng goodnes & full gracyous among all the worthy men of the  world  / for he passed & shone by vertue of grace gyue¯ to hym from god aboue all his pmdecessours y• were noble men & worthy & he was a well herted man & an hardy for he drad neuer no myshappes ne barmes ne euyl fortune y• myght fall a noble warryour & a fortunate / for both on lo¯de & see & in al batayles & assembles wt a passing glory & ioy he had y• victory / he was meke / benigne / homely / sobre & soft to al men as wel to strangers as to his owne subiectes & to other y• were vnder his gouernaumce / he was deuout & holy both to god & holy chirche / for he worshipped holpe & maynteyned holy chirch & theyr mynistres wt al maner reuere¯ce / he was tre table & well auysed in re¯porall & worldly nedes / wyse in coumseyle / & discrece & meke to speke wt / in his dedes & maners ge¯tyl & well taught / hauy¯g pite on them y• were in disease / plenteous in gyuyng e  benefaytes & almes / besy & curyous in buylding / & lyghtly he bare & suffred wro¯ges & harmes / & whan he was gyue¯ to ony occupacyon he left all other thynges for y• tyme & tended therto / semely of body & a mene stature / hauyng alway to hygh & to lowe a good chere. And there spro¯ge & shone so moche grace of hym y• what ma¯ had behold his face / or had dremed of hy¯ he hoped y• daye y• al thynge shold hap to hym ioyfull & lykyng. And he gouerned his kingdom gloriously vnto his age / he was large in gyuyng & wyse in expe¯ces   he was fulfylled with al honeste of good maners & vertues / vnder whom to lyue it was as for to regne / wherfore his fame & his loos spronge so ferre y• it came in to hethynnesse & Barbary / shewynge & tellynge his worthynes & manhode in all londes / & y• no londe vnder heuen had brought forth so noble a kyng / so gentyll & so blissed / or might reyse suche another wham he was deed. Neuertheles lechery & meuynge of his flesshe haumted hym in his age / wherfore the rather as it is to suppose for vumesurable fulfyllynge of his lust his lyfe shorted the sooner. And hereof take good hede lyke as his dedes bereth wytnes / for as in his begy¯nyng all thynges were Ioyfull and lykyng to hym & to all people. And in his myddle age he passed all people in hygh Ioye / worshyp & blyssednes. Ryght so whan he drewe in to age drawyng downward through lechery & other synnes lytell & lytell all those Ioyfull & blyssed thynges and prosperyte decreased & myshapped / and unfortunate thynges and vnprofytable harmes with many euyls began for to sprynge / and the more harme is / it contynued longe tyme after. CLemens y• syxth was pope after Benedict .x. yere. This ma¯ in name & dede was vertuous / & many thynges y• Benedict was rigous in / he made easy / & certeyn that he depryued he restored / & the rygousnes of y• fayth of Benedict was laudable / but moche more laudable was y• mekenes of Clement. This man was a noble prechour / & many sermons he gadred / & let no man passe from hym but he gaue hym good coumseyle / & decessed a blissed man.  Karolus y• .iiij. was emperour after Lodewyk .xxxj. yere. This ma¯ was kyng of Beme a wyse man & a myghty / & this ma¯ was chosen emperour by y• commaumdement of Clement Lodewyk beynge alyue in his contemacy / & bycause he asked mekely the popes blessynge and to be crowned of hym / as other good kynges did / therfore he was protected of god / & preuayled ouer al his enemyes / & many fauourable lawes he made to spirytuall men / the whiche yet are called Karolma. At y• last he decessed a ryche ma¯ in vertue & goodes.  Inno centius the .vj. was pope after Clement x. yere / and he was a grete louer of relygyous men / & he founded a monastery in Fraumce of y• ordre of Cartusiens / & was a grete canonyst.  Vrban{us} the .v. was pope after Innocent. This man was abbot of Missolens of y• ordre of say¯t Benet a doctour / & is taken for a saynt. He made the crosse to be preched agaynst y• turkes And he made a passage to y• turkes. And to hym say¯t Brigyt was sent from Chryst for the co¯firmacyon of theyr rule / & than he was poysoned & decessed.  Gregory the .xj. was pope after hym .viij. yere. This Gregory dyd lytell / & after him folowed y• tribulacyon y• our lorde shewed to saynt Brigit for the synne of y• clergy.  Wenselans sone to Karolus aforesaid was emperour .xiiij. yere / and he was a chylde / and was chosen whan his fader was on lyue / but he toke no kepe of the empyre. And wham he was warned many tymes to take hede vnto it and wold not / he was deposed. For he gaue all his delyte and lust vnto lechery / & the ende was without honour / for he went gretly from the maners & the vertues of his noble fader. And he was crowned with the imperyall dyademe / & the wysdome of his fader passed in to Sygysmumd his broder / as after it shall appere.  Vrbanus was pope after Gregory .vj. yere. This Vrban was chosen in the Cite of Rome by strength of y• Romayns / but y• cardynals dyd that for drede & not wyllyngly / wherfore they fledde to y• Cite of   Fumdorum. And they sayd that he was not pope / & chose in his place syr Roberte of Gebennys the same yere / whiche was called Clement the .vij.  Nota.  And here began the .xxij. stryte in the chirche And it was more worse than euer was ony other before. For it was so subtyll / y• the wysest men that were & the best conscyenced coude not discerne with whom it was best to saye and holde.

And thus our Englysshe lordes thanked be   god had the felde.  In the .xvij. yere of kyng Rychardes regne dyed the good & gracious quene Anne that was wyfe to kyng Richard in the manoyre of Shene in the shyre of Surrey on whytsondaye And than was she brought to London & so to Westmynster / & there was she buryed and worthely entered besyde saynt Edwardes shryne / vpon whose soule almyghty god haue pyte & mercy Amen.  How kynge Rycharde spoused dame Isabell y• kynges doughter of Fraumce in the towne of Calays / & brought her in to Englo¯de & let her be crowned quene in y• abbey of saynt Peters of Westmynster. IN the .xx. yere of kyng Rychardes regne he went ouer see to Calays with dukes / erles / lordes and barons / & many other worthy squyers with grete araye and comyn people of the realme in good araye as longed to suche a kynge & pry¯ce of his nobley and of his owne persone to do hym reuerence & obseruaunce as ought to be done to theyr lyege lorde & so myghty a kynge & emperour in his owne / to abyde & receyue there that worthy & gracyous lady that sholde be his wyfe a yonge creature of .xix. yere of age dame Isabell the kynges doughter of Fraumce / & many other worthy lordes of grete name / bothe barons & knyghtes / with moche other people that came to y• towne of Grauenynge and two dukes of Fraumce / that one was the duke of Burgoyn / and that other the duke of Barre that wold no ferther lesse than they had pledges for them. And than kynge Rycharde delyuered two pledges for them to go safe and come safe his two worthy vncles / the duke of Glocestre & the duke of Yorke / & these two went ouer y• water of Grauenyng & abode there as for pledges vnto y• tyme that the maryage & the feest was done & that these two dukes of Fraumce were comen agayn vnto  Grauenynge water. And than these two worthy dukes came ouer y• water at Grauenyng & so to Calays with this worshyp full lady dame Isabell y• was y• kynges doughter of Fraumce / and with her came many a worthy  lord  & lady & knyghtes & squyers in y• best araye that myght be And there they met wt our meynr at Calays whiche welcomed her & her meyny wt grete reuerence / & so brought her in to the towne of Calays / & there she was receyued wt all the solempnite & worshyp y• might be done to suche a lady. And than they brought her to y• kyng / & the kynge toke her & welcomed her & all her fayre company / & made there a grete solempnite And than y• kyng & his coumseyle asked of the frensshe lordes whether all the couenaumtes & forwardes wt the co¯posycyon y• were ordeyned & made on bothe partyes shold be truly kepte & holde¯ bySpan  the¯ And they sayd ye / & there they swore & toke theyr charge vpon a boke and made theyr othe well & truly it to holde i al maner poyntes & couenaumces wtout contradic cyon or delay in ony maner wyse. And than was she brought to say¯t Nicolas chirche in Calays / & there was worthely wedded wt the moost solempnite y• ony kyng or quene myght be / wt archebysshops & bysshops & all y• mynystres of holy chirche. And than they were brought to the castell & set to meet / & were serued wt all delycasy of ryall metes & dry¯kes plenteously to all maner of straumgers & al other & no creature warned y• feest / but al were welcome / for there were grece halles & tentes set vpon y• grene wtout y• castell to receiue al maner of people / & euery office redy to serue the¯ all. And thus this worthy mariage was solemply done & ended with all ryalte. Than these two dukes of Fraumce with theyr people toke theyr leue of the kynge & of the quene & wente   agayne vnto Grauenynge water. And there the Frensshe lordes / that is to saye the two dukes & all theyr folke were comen ouer the water to Grauenyng / and there they mette / & euerichoue toke leue at other / & so they departed / & our lordes came agayne to Calays / & the Frensshe lordes wente ouer the water / & so home in to Fraunce agayne. And anone after the kyng made hym redy with ye quene and all his lordes & ladyes and all theyr people with them & came ouer ye see in to Englonde / and so vnto London. And the Mayre and the sheryues with all the aldermen & worthy comyns rode agaynst them vnto the blacke heth in Kent / and there they mette with the kyng and the quene / & welcomed them & that in good araye / and euery man in the clothyng of his craft & theyr mynstrels before them And so they brought them to saynt Geor ges barre in Southwerke / & there they toke theyr leue. And the kynge and the quene rode to Kenyngton / and than the people of London turned home agayn / & in turnynge agayne to London brydge there was so grete prese of people bothe on hors & on fote / that there were deed on the brydge .xi. persones of men & women and chyldren / on whose soules god haue mercy & pyte Amen. And than afterwarde the quene was brought to the toure of London / and there she was all nyght / & on ye morowe she was brought through the cite of London / and so forth to Westmynster / & there she was crowned quene of Englonde / & than she was brought agayne vnto ye kynges palays and there was holden open courte and a ryall feest at her crownacyon of all maner people that thyder came. And this was done the sondaye nexte after the feest of saynt Clement / in the .xx. yere of kynge Rychardes regne.  And than the .xxv. daye of August nexte after by euyll excitacyon & fals coumseyle and grete wrath & malyce that the kynge had of olde tyme to his vncle the good duke of Glocestre & to the erle of Arundell / & to ye erle of war wyk. Anone the kyng by his euyll excitacyon & his euyll counseyle and malyce late in the euenynge on the same daye aboue sayd ma edy wt his strength and rode in to   to ye towne of Chelmel ord / and  o came to Plasshe sodeynly there syr Thomas of Wodstok ye good duke of Glocestre laye. And ye good duke came anone to welcome the kynge. And the kynge arested ye good duke hymselfe his owne body / & so he was ladde down to the water / & anone put in to a shyppe and had to Calays / & brought in to ye capytayns warde to be kepte in holde by ye kynges commaundement. And that tyme the erle Marshall was capytayn of Calays. And anone after by commaumdement of the kynge & by his fals coumseyle / commaumded yt capytayn to put hym to deth. And anone certayn yemen that had the good duke in kepyng toke theyr coumseyle how that they sholde put hym to dethe. And this was theyr appoyntment / that they shold come vpon hy¯ whan he were in his bedde & a slepe on a fether bedde / & anone they boumde hym hande & fote and charged hym for to lye styll. And whan that they had done thus / they toke two towelles / & made on them two rydynge knottes / & cast the towelles aboute his necke / & than they toke the fether bedde that laye vnder hym & cast it vpon hym and than they drewe theyr towelles eche wayes / & some laye vpon ye fether bedde and vpon hym vnto the tyme yt he was deed / bycause yt he sholde make no noyse And thus they strangled this worthy duke vnto ye deth / vpon whose soule god for his hygh pyte haue mercy. Amen.  And whan the kyng had thus arested this worthy duke & his vncle and sente   hym to Calays he came agayn to London in all ye haste with a wonders grete nonbre of people. And as soone as he was comen he sent for y• erle of Arundell / & for the good erle of warwyk. And anone as they came he arested them hymself / and syr Iohn Cobham and syr Iohn Cheyn knyghtes he arested them in yt same ma ner tyll he made his parliament / & anone they were put into holde / but the erle of Arundell went at large vnto the parly a ment tyme / for he foumde sufficient surety to abyde the lawe / & to answere to all ma ner poyntes that ye kynge & his coumseyle wolde put vpon hy¯.  And the .xxi. yere of kynge Rychardes regne he ordeyned hy¯ a parlyament at Westmynster whiche was called yt grete parlyament. And this parliament was made for to iudge these thre worthy lordes & other moo as them lyst at that tyme. And for yt iudgement the kyng let make in all the haste a long hous & a large of tymbre ye whiche was called an hall / & couered with tyles ouer / & it was open all aboute on bothe sydes & at the endes / yt all maner of men myght se throughout / & there the dome was holden vpon these foresayd lordes & iudgemet gyuen at this foresayd parlyament. And for to come to this parlyament the kyng sent his wrytes to euery lorde / baron / knyght & s uyer in euery shyre throughout Englonde / that euery lorde sholde gadre & brynge his retynue with hym in as shorte tyme & in the best araye yt they myght ge e / in mayntey yage & strengthinge of ye kyng agaynst them yt were his enemyes / & that this were done in all the haste & come to hym   payne of deth. And the kyng hymself sent into Cl  shyre to che taines of ye  tree / & they gadred & brought a grete and an huge multytude of people bothe of knyghtes &  uyers & pryncypally of yemen of Chestershyre / whiche ye ten & archers the kyng toke to his own courte and gaue them bowge of courte & good wages to be kepers of his owne body bothe by nyght & by daye aboue al other persones & moost loued & best trust / the whiche soone afterward turned ye kyng to grete losse & shame / hyndrynge & his vtter vndoynge & destruccion as ye shall here afterwarde. And that tyme came sir Henry of Derby with a grete meyny of men of armes & archers. And ye erle of Rutlonde came with a stronge power of people bothe of men of armes & archers The erle of Kent brought a grete power of men of armes & archers / the erle Mar shall came in the same maner / & the lord  Spenser in the same maner. The erle of Northumberlonde and sir Henry Pe  his sone / & syr Thomas Pet y the erles broder / all the worthy lordes brought a fayre meyny & a stronge power / and eche man in his best aray / & the duke of Lancastre & the duke of yorke came in ye same maner with men of armes & archers folowyng ye kyng / & syr Willyam S rope tresourer of Englonde came in the same maner. And thus in this araye came all the worthy men of this londe vnto our kyng / & all this people came to London in one daye / in so moche yt euery   lane in London & in the subbarbes were full of them lodged / and .x. or. x . myle about London euery waye. And this peo ple brought the kyng to Westmynster   went home agayne to theyr lodgyng s bothe hors & man / & than on ye monday  the .xii. daye of September ye pa  began at Westmynster whiche was cal led yt grete parlyament. And on yt frydaye next after ye erle of A dell was brought in to the parlyament amonge all ye lordes and yt was on saynt Mathewes day the apostle and euangelist / there he was for iudged vnto the deth in this hall yt was made in ye palays at Westmynster. And   this was his iudgement. He shold go on fote wt his handes boumde behynde hym from ye place that he was iudged in / & so forth through the cite of London vnto ye toure hyll / & his heed to be smytten of / & so it was done in dede in the same place. And .vl. of the gretest lordes that sate on his iudgement rode with hym vnto the place there he was done to dethe / & so to se that ye execucyon were done after the dome / & by the kynges commaundement with them wente on fote men of armes & archers a grete multytude of Chestre shyre men / in strengthynge of ye lordes yt brought this erle to his dethe / for they were in drede leest ye erle sholde be rescowed & taken from them whan they came in to London. Thus he passed forth through the Cite vnto his deth / & there he toke it full pacyently / on whose soule god haue mercy Amen. And than came the Austyn freres & toke vp ye body & the heed of this good erle / & bare it home to theyr place / & buryed him in theyr quere And on yt morow after was syr Rychard erle of warwik brought in to the parlya ment there as the erle of Arundell was for iudged / & they gaue the erle of warwyk the same iudgement that ye foresayd erle had / but the lordes had compassyon on hym bycause he was of more greter age / and released hym to perpetuall pry son / & put hym in the yle of Man. And than on the mondaye nexte after ye lorde Cobham of Kent and syr Iohn Cheyn knyght were brought also in to the parlyament in to the same hall / & there they were iudged to be hanged and drawen / but through the prayers and grete instaunce of all the lordes that iudgement was forgyuen them / and released to per petuall pryson.  And this same tyme was Rychard Whyttyngdon Mayre of London / and Iohn Wodecocke & Wyllyam Askam sheryues of London. And they ordeyned at euery gate of London durynge this same parlyament stronge watche of men of armes & archers / and through out euery warde also. And the kynge made .v. dukes & one Markeys & foure erles / & the fyrst of them was the erle of Derby / and he was made duke of Herford / and the seconde was the erle of Rutlonde / & he was made duke of Awemarle / & the thyrde was the erle of Kent and he was made duke of Surry / & the fourth was the erle of Hunty¯gdon / & he was made duke of Excestre / & the fyfth was the erle of Notyngham / & he was made duke of Northfolk. And the erle of Somerset was made Markeys of Dor set / & the lorde Spenser was made erle of Glocestre / & the lorde Neuyll of Raby was made erle of Westmerlonde / & syr Thomas Percy was made erle of Worcestre / & syr Willyam Scrope that was tresourer of Englonde was made erle of Wylshyre / & syr Iohn Montagu erle of Salisbury. And whan ye king had thus done he helde the parlyament & ryall feest vnto all his lordes & to all maner of people that thyder wolde come.  And this same yere dyed syr Iohn of Gaumt ye kynges vncle & duke of Lancastre in the bysshops Inne in Holborne / & was brought fro thens to saynt Paule / & there ye kyng made & helde his enterement well & worthely with al his lordes in the chirche of saynt Paule in London / & there he was buryed besyde dame Blaumche his wyfe that was doughter & heyre vnto ye good Henry yt was duke of L te.  In ye same yere there fell a  cyon bytwene the duke of Herford & ye duke of Norfolke in so moche y• they waged batayle & cast down theyr gloues / & than they were ta ken vp & ensealed / & the batayle ioyned & the daye set / & the place assygned where and whan / & this sholde be at Couentre And thyder came the kyng wt all his lor   des at that day / & was set in the felde / & than these two worthy lordes came into ye felde well & clene armed & well arayed with all theyr wepen & redy to do theyr batayle / & were redy in ye place to fyght at vtteraumce. But ye kyng had them cesse & toke the quarell in to his handes. And forth with ryght there present exiled the duke of Herford for terme of .x. yere / & the duke of Norfolke for euermore. And syr Thomas Arundell archebisshop of Caum terbury was exiled yt same tyme for euer & deposed out of his see for malyce of the kyng. And anone these thre worthy lordes were commaunded & defended ye kynges realme. And anone they gate them shyppes at dyuers hauens & went ouer the see in to dyuers lo¯des eche his waye And ye duke of Norfolke went to Venise & there he died / on whose soule god haue mercy Amen. And than kynge Rychard made a clerke of his syr Roger Walden arche bysshop of Caumterbury.  And in the .xxij. yere of kynge Richardes regne by fals coumseyle & ymaginacyon of couetous men that were aboute hym were made & ordeyned blancke chartres / and made them to be ensealed of al maner ry the men throughout ye realme / in so moche yt they compelled diuers people to set theyr seales therto. And this was done for grete couetyse / wherfore al good hertes of ye realme were clene turned away fro ye kyng for euer after. And that was vtter destruccyon & ende to hym yt was so hygh & so excellent a prynce & kyng / & through couetous & fals coumseyle falsely betrayed. Alas for pyte ye suche a kynge myght not se. And than kynge Rychard set his kyngdome and his ryall londe of Englonde to ferme vnto foure persones whiche were these / syr Wyllyam Scrope erle of Wylshyre & tresourer of Englond & syr Iohn Busshe / & Henry Grene / & syr Iohn Bagot knyghtes / whiche turned them to myschefe & deth within a lytell tyme / as ye shall fynde here afterwarde wryten.  And than kyng Rychard ma de grete ordynaumce & went hymself ouer see into Irlonde & many grete lordes wt hym with grete hoostes for to strength theyr kynge / wt men of armes & archers & moche grete stuffe & ryght good ordynaumce as longed vnto warre. And or he passed ouer ye see he ordeyned & made   Edmond of Langley his vncle ye duke of Yorke his lewtenaum  of Englonde in his absence / with the gouernaumce & coumsey e of these .iiij. knyghtes yt had taken Englonde to ferme of the kyng. And than he passed the see & came in to Irlonde and there he was well & worth ly receyued And these rebelles that ben called   Irysshmen came downe to the kynge & yelded them to him bothe body & go des all at his owne wyll / & swore vnto   to be his lyege men / & there dyd to hym homage & feaute & good seruyce & thus he conquered ye moost parte of Irlende in a lytell tyme. And whyle that kyng   chard was thus in Irlonde syr Henry of Bolyngbroke erle of Derby that ye kyng had made before duke of Herford y•   che duke the kyng had exiled out of this londe was comen agayn in to Englonde for to chalenge ye dukedom of Lancast  as for his right & true herytage. And he came downe out of Fraumce vnto  alays And there mette hy¯ syr Thomas Arundell yt was archebysshop of   that was exiled out of Englond & wi  hym came the erle of Arundel his so  & heyre the whiche was in kepynge of syr Iohn shelley knight somtyme wt  he erle of Huntyngdon & wt the duke of Excestre the whiche was tho in the castell of   gate in Sussex & there he stale awaye & came to Calays / & there he was well & worthely kepte tyll these other two lordes were comen to Calays. And than this   worthy duke & the archebysshop of Caumterbury Arundell shypped in ye hauen of Calais / & drewe theyr course northward & arryued in Yorkshyre at Rauensporne fast by Wydelyngton / & there he came & entred fyrst the londe / & two lordes with hym and theyr meyny. And than moche people of the realme that herde of his comynge & knewe where yt he was / anone they drewe vnto hym & welcomed these lordes / & so couraged them in all maner thynge / and passed forth in to the londe and gadred moche people to them. And whan kyng Rychard herde & wyst that these two lordes were comen agayne in to Englonde and were londed. Than the kynge lefte his ordynaumce in Irlonde & came in to Englondward in all the haste that he myght / and came to the castell of  lyut / and there he abode for to take his counseyle & what myght be done / but to hym came none. And wham syr Thomas Percy erle of Worcestre yt was ye kynges steward wyst and knewe this / anone he came in to the hall amonge all ye people / and he brake the yerde of ye ryall kynges housholde / & anone euery man was disperpied & went his waye & forsoke theyr mayster & souerayn lorde / and lefte hym alone. And thus was kynge Rycharde brought downe & destroyed / & stode hym selfe alone without comforte or socour or ony good counseyle of ony man / alas for pite of this ryall kyng. And anone came tydy¯ges that syr Henry of Boling broke was vp with a stronge power of people and that all ye squyers of Englonde reysed vp the shyres in strengthyng of hym agaynst kyng Rychard. And thus soone he was comen out of the North coumtree to Brystowe / & there he mette with syr Wyllyam Scrope erle of Wylshyre and tresourer of Englonde / & with syr Iohn Busshe and syr Henry Grene / and Iohn Bagot / but he escaped from them & went ouer the see in to Irlonde. And these thre knyghtes were taken and theyr herdes smytten of. And thus they died for theyr fals couetyse. And than was kynge Rychard taken and brought vnto the duke And anone ye duke put hy¯ in fast warde and stronge holde vnto his comynge to London. And than was there a rumour in London & a stronge noyse that kynge Rychard came to Westmynster / and the people of London ranne thyder & wolde haue done moche harme & hurte in theyr woodnes / had not ye Mayre & aldermen and other worthy men cessed them with fayre wordes / and turned them home agayne to London.  And there was syr Iohn Slake dene of the kynges chapell of Westmynster taken & brought to London / & put in pryson in Ludgate. And after that Iohn Bagot was taken in Irlonde & brought to London / & put in prison in Newgate / there to be kepte and abyde his answere.  And soone after the duke brought kynge Rycharde pryuely to London / & put him in the toure vnder sure kepynge as a prysoner. And than came the lordes of the realme wt al theyr coumseyle vnto ye toure to kynge Rychard & sayd to hym of his mysgouernaunce & extorcion that he had done / made & ordeyned to oppresse all ye comyn people / & also to all the realme. Wherfore all ye comyn people of ye realme wolde haue hym deposed of his kyngdome. And so he was deposed at that tyme in the toure of London by all his lordes counseyle & comyn assent of all ye realme. And than he was put from ye toure vnto ye castell of Ledes in Kent / & there he was kepte a whyle / and than he was had from thens vnto ye castell of Pounfret in the North countre to be kepte in prison / & ryght soone after there he made his ende. And than whan kyng Rychard was deposed & had  sygued his crowne & his kyngdom & was   kepte fast in holde. Than al the lordes of the realme with the romyns assent & by accorde chose this worthy lorde syr Henry of Bolyngbroke erle of Derby / duke of Herford & duke of Lancastre by ryght lyne & herytage / and for his ryghtfull manhode that ye people foumde in him before all other they chose hym & made hy¯ kynge of Englonde amonge them. INnocen  the .vij. chosen pope at two yere. And than Gr gory the .xij. was after hy¯ xij. yere  euet was debate. Than was Alexander chosen in ye coumsoyle of  ysan & he was called syr & P trus de Canadia & so was put & ryferd s ryfe / euery cho e of those thre sayd he was pope: Than was there a counseyle at  ys n where they began to make a co¯corde / and there they deposed ye two / & the thyrde stode / & so was worse diuisyon made than before For that they ordeyned preuayled not.  Robert was emperour after Wenselans .ix. yere. This ma¯ was duke of Bauary & erle of Palatyn / a iust man and a good / & was crowned of Bonifate the. ix This man entred ytaly wt a grete hoost of Almayns agaynst Iohn the duke of Galias / but he returned wt a grete woumde / & was a thynge iust that he suffred by iustyce diuyne.  Iohn the .xxiij. succeded Alexander .iiij. yere / & fyrst he began well for an vnite / & he was in ye coumsey e   Constance / & offred hy¯ to resigne the poperyche / & after secretly & vntruly he fledde awaye / but it {pro}fyted hym not / for he was taken & co¯strayned to peas / & was made a cardynall / & buryed at Florens.  Sigismundus was emperour after Robert .xxvij. yere / & he was sone to Ka olus & kynge of Vngary & moost chrysten prynce / and he was so deuoute to god that he deserued to be canonysed. This man holpe ye chirche through his meruaylous prudence and wytte / for he spared no labour ne no thynge yt he had tyll he had made a full peas amonge the clergy. And he had.  x. batayles agaynst the Turke / & euer he had ye  ry. And what more / all thynge yt euer was wryten in  ouynge to Constantyne / Theodosio / Kat lo /  tto / may truly be wryten of hym. And he was crowned in Vngary / and decessed a blyssed man.  Circa annum dn¯i. M .CCCC.  Of syr Henry of Bolyng broke erle of Derby that regned after kyng Rycharde / whiche was the fourth Henry after the conquest. ANd after kynge Rychard the seconde was deposed & out of his kingdom / the lordes & the comyns al  one assent & all other worthy men of the realme chose syr Henry of Bolyng broke erle of Derby sone & heyre of Iohn  uke of Lancastre for his worthy manhode yt often tymes had ben founde in hym & in dedes preued / vpon say¯t Edwardes day the confessour he was crowned kynge of Englo¯de at Westmynster by assent of all the realme nexte after the depo nge of kyng Richard. Than he made Henry his eldest sone pry¯ce of Wales & duke of Cornewayle & erle of Chestre. And he ma  syr Thomas of Arumdell archbysshop of Caumterbury agayne as he was before. And syr Roger Walden ye kyng Rychard had made archebysshop of Caumterbury he made bysshop of London / for ye  yme it stode voyde. And he made ye erles sone of Arundell that came wt hym ouer ye see from Calays in to Englonde erle of Arundell as his fader had ben / & put hym in possessyon of all his londes. And he made homage & feaute vnto his lyege lorde the kynge as all other lordes had done. And than anone dyed kynge Rychard in   the castell of Pounfret in the north countree for there he was famysshed to deth by his keper / for he was kept there .iiij. or .v. dayes from meet & drynke / & so he made his ende in this world. Yet moche people in Englonde and in other londes sayd yt he was on lyue many a yere after his deth. But whether he were alyue or deed the people helde theyr fals opinyon & byleue that many had / & moche people came to grete myschefe & foule dethe as ye shal here afterward. And whan kyng Henry wyst & knewe yt he was deed / he let  ere hym in the best maner / & closed it in a fayre chest wt dyuers spyceryes and ba o es / & closed hym in a lynnen cloth all saue his visage / & that was left open that all men myght se his persone from all other men. And so he was brought to London with torche light brennynge to saint Paules chirche / & there he had his masse & his Dirige wt moche reuere¯ce & solempnite of seruyce. And wham all this was done / he was brought from saynt Paules in to the abbey of Westmynster & there he had al his hole seruyce agayn And from Westmy¯ster he was brought to Langley / and there he was buryed / on whose soule god haue mercy Amen.  And in ye fyrst yere of kynge Henryes regue he helde his Chrystmasse in ye castell of Wyndsore. And on .xij. euen came the duke of Awemarle vnto the kynge & colde hym that he & the duke of Surrey & the duke of Excestre / & the erle of Salisbury / & ye erle of Glocestre / & other moo of theyr affynite were accorded to make a mommynge vnto ye kynge on .xij. daye at nyght / & there they purposed to slee ye kyng in the reuelyng. And thus ye duke of Awemarle warned ye kyng. And than the kyng came to London pryuely in all the haste yt he myght to gete hym helpe socour & comforte and coumseyle. And anone these other yt wolde haue put ye kynge to deth fledde in all the haste yt they myght for they knewe well that theyr coumseyle was bewrayed.

And than anone our lordes yt were embassadours toke theyr leue & came in to Englonde agayne & tolde the kynge & his couseyle of the vngoodly answere yt they had of the Dolphin / & of the present y• whiche he had sente to our kynge. And whan the kynge had herde theyr wordes & y• answere of y• Dolphyn he was wonders sore agreued & ryght euyll apayed towarde the frensshmen & towarde the kynge & the Dolphyn / and thought to aue¯ge hym on them as soone as god  wold  sende hym grace & myght And anone let make tenes balles for the Dolphyn in all y• haste that he myght / & they were grete gonstones for the Dolphyn to playe withall. And than anone the kynge sent for all the lordes & helde a grete coumseyle at Westmynster / & told to them the answer yt they had of the Dolphin & of his worthy present yt he sent to hym & to his lordes to playe wtall. And there ye kyng & his lordes were accorded that they shold be redy in armes wt theyr power in the best araye yt myght be done and gete all the men of armes & archers that myght be goten / & all other stuffe yt longed to warre / & to be redy wt all theyr retynue to mete at Southhampton by La¯masse nexte folowynge without ony delaye / wherfore ye kynge ordeyned his nauy of shyppes with all maner stuffe & vytayle that longed to suche a warryour of all maner ordynaunce in the hauen of Southhampton to ye nombre of .CCC. and .xx. sayles. And than fell there a grete dysease and a foule myschefe. For there were thre lordes whiche that the kyng trusted moche on / & through false couetyse they had purposed & ymagined the kynges deth / & thought to haue slayne hym & all his bretherne or he had taken the see / whiche thre lordes were named thus / syr Rycharde erle of Cambrydge broder to ye duke of yorke / ye seconde was the lord Scrope tresourer of Englo¯de / y• thyrd was sir Thomas Gray knyght of   the North coumtree. And these thre lordes aforesayd for lucre of money had made a promesse vnto y• Frensshmen for to haue slayne kyng Henry the fyfth and all his bretherne by a false trayne sodeynly or they had ben ware. But almyghty god of his grete grace helde his holy hande ouer them & saued them from these perillous meiny. And for to haue done this they receyued of y• frensshmen a millyon of gold / & that was there openly proued And for theyr fals treason they were all thre iudged to deth / & this was y• iudgement / that they sholde be ladde through Hampton / & without northgate there to be heded. And thus they ended theyr lyues for theyr fals couetyse and treason. And anone as this was done the kynge & all his meyny made them redy & went to shyppe and sayled forth with .xv. hondred shyppes / & arryued within Seyne at Kydecause vpon our ladyes euen the Assumpcyon in Normandy wt all his ordynaumce / & so went forth to Harflet / & he besyeged the towne all about by londe & also by water / & sent to the capytayne of the towne & charged hym to delyuer the towne. And ye capytayne sayd that he delyuered hym none / ne none he wolde hy¯ yelde / but badde hym do his best. And than our kyng layde his ordinaumce vnto the towne / that is to saye / gonnes / engynes & tripgettes / and shotte & cast at the walles & eke at the towne / & cast downe bothe toures & towne & layde them on y• erth / & there he played at the tenes with his hard gonne stones. And they y• were with in y• towne whan they sholde playe theyr songe was well away & alas that euer ony suche tenes balles were made / & cursed al tho y• warre began / & y• tyme that euer they were borne.  And on the morowe y• kyng let crye at euery gate of the towne that euery man  shold  be redy on the morowe erly to make assaute to y• towne. And Willyam Boucher & Iohn Graumt with .xij. other worthy burgeses came to the kyng & besought hym of his ryall pryncehode & power to withdrawe his malyce & bestruccyon that he dyd to them / and besought hym of .viij. dayes respyte & trewse yf ony rescowe myght come to them / & els to yelde vp ye towne to hym wt al theyr goodes. And than the kyng sent forth y• capytayne & kepte the remenaumt styll wt hym. And y• lord Gaucorte yt was capytayne of y• towne went forth to Roen in all ye haste vnto the Dolphyn for helpe & socour / but there was none ne no man of rescowe / for the Dolphyn  wold  not abyde. And thus this capytayne came agayne vnto the kynge & yelded vp ye towne / & delyuered hym the keys. And than he called his vncle ye erle of Dorset & made hym capytayne of the town of Harflet / & deliuered him y• keys & bad hy¯ go & put out all y• fre¯sshe people bothe men women & children / & stuffe his town of Harflet wt englysshe people. And than ye kyng sent in to Englo¯de & let crye in euery good town of Englo¯de / y• what crafty ma¯ wold come thyder & enhabyte hym there in y• town he shold haue  s &  houshold  to hy¯ & to his heyres for euer more. And thyder went many marchaumtes & crafty men / & enhabyted them there to strength the towne / & were welcome. And wham y• kyng sawe y• this town was well stuffed bothe of vytayles & of men / this worthy prince toke his leue & went toward Calays by lond / & y• frensshmen herde of his comynge / they thought for to haue stopped hy¯ his waye y• he sholde not passe that waye / in all y• haste y• they myght brake al y• bridges where as ony passage was for hors & man / in so moche that there myght no man passe ouer the ryuers neyther on hors ne on fo e / but yf he shold haue bendrowned. And therfore our king wt all his people went & sought   his way ferre vp toward Paris / & there was all y• ryall power of Fraumce assembled & redy to gyue hym batayle / & for to destroye all his people. But almyghty god was his guyde & saued hy¯ & all his meyny / & defended hym of his enemyes power & purpose thanked be god y• saued so his owne knyght & kyng in his ryght full tytel. And than our kyng beholdyng & seynge y• grete multytude & nombre of his enemyes to withstande his waye & gyue hym batayle. Than the kyng wt a meke herte & a good spiryte lyfte vp his handes to almyghty god / & besought hy¯ of his helpe / & y• daye to saue his true seruaumtes. Than our kynge gadred all his lordes & other people aboute & bad them al to be of good chere / for they shold haue a fayre & a gracyous victory & the better of all theyr enemyes / & prayed them to make the¯ redy to y• batayle / for he wolde rather dye y• daye in the felde / than to be taken of his enemyes / for he wold neuer put y• realme of Englonde to raumsom for his persone. And y• duke of Yorke fell on his knees & besought y• kyng of a bone / y• he  wold  graumt hym yt daye y• vaumtward in his batayle / & the kyng graumted hym his askyng / and sayd gramercy cosyn of Yorke / & prayed hym to make hym redy. And than badde he euery man to ordeyn hym a stake of tree & sharpe bothe endes that y• stake myght be pyght in y• erth a slope / that theyr enemyes shold not ouer come them on horsback / for yt was theyr fals purpose / & arayed them for to ouer ryde our meyny sodeynly at the fyrst comyng on of them at y• first brunt. And al the nyght before y• batayle y• frensshmen made many grete fyers & moche reuell with howting & showting / & played our kyng & his lordes at y• dyse / & an archer alwaye for a blanke of theyr money / for they wend al had be¯ theyrs. The morne  ose y• daye gan sprynge / & the kyng by good aduyse let araye his batayle & his wynges / & charged euery man to kepe them hole togyder / & prayed them all to be of good chere. And wham they were redy he asked what tyme of ye daye it was & they said pryme. Than sayd our kyng now is good tyme / for al englo¯d prayeth for vs: & therfore be of good chere & let vs go to our iourney. And than he sayd wt an hye voyce / in the name of almighty god & saynt George auaumt baner / & saynt George this day thyne helpe. And than the Frensshmen came pryckynge downe as they wold haue ouer rydden all our meyny / but god and our archers made them ryght soone to stomble / for our archers shotte neuer arowe amysse / but it perysshed & brought to ye groumde bothe hors & man / for they shotte yt daye for a wager. And our stakes made them toppe ouer terue eche one ouer ouer / y• they laye on hepes two speres length of heyght. And our kyng wt his meyny & with his men of armes & archers yt thacked on them so thycke with arowes & layde on wt stakes And our kyng with his handes fought manly y• daye. And thus almyghty god & saynt George brought our enemyes to groumde / & gaue vs that daye the victory There were slayne of frensshmen yt daye in ye felde of Agincourt m  than .xi. M. Without prysoners yt were taken / & there were nombred that daye of Frensshmen in the felde moo than syxe score. M. But god that daye fought for vs. And after came there tydynges to our kynge that there was a newe batayle of frensshmen ordeyned redy for to stele on hym & came towardes hym. And anone our kyng let crye that euery man sholde slee his prysouers that he had taken / & anone araye the batayle agayne redy to fyght with the Frensshmen. And whan the Frensshmen sawe that our men kylled downe theyr prysoners / than they withdrewe   them & brake theyr batayle and al theyr araye. And thus our kyng as a worthy conquerour had that daye the victory in the  elde of Agincourt in Pycardy. And than our kynge returned agayn where as the batayle was / for to  e what people were slayne of Englysshmen / and yf ony were hurte y• they myght be holpen And there were deed in y• felde the duke of Barry / the duke of Alaumson / the duke of Braband / the erle of Nauerne thefe constable of Fraumce / and .viij. other erles and the archebysshop of Saunce / and of good barons an .C. and mo / & of worthy knyghtes of grete alyaunce of cote armures .xv. ho¯dred.

And this batayle was on a frydaye / whiche was saynt Crispyne & Crispinians day in the moneth of October / & anone the kynge commaumded to bury them / and the duke of Yorke to be caryed forth wt hym & the erle of Suffolke. And there were prysoners y• duke of Orlyaumce / the duke of Burbon / the erle of Vendome / the erle of Ewe / the erle of Richemond & syr But sigaumt marsha   f Fraumce / & many other worthy lordes were taken there in this batayle of Agincourt & were brought to the towne of Calays / & so ouer the see wt the kyng in to Englonde & londed at Douer in Kent wt all his prysoners in safete thanked be almyghty god / & so came to Cas terbury & offred at saynt Thomas shryne. And so forth he rode through the  o re of Kent the next waye to Eitham & th re he rested tyll that he wolde come to London. And than the Mayre of London / the aldermen & sheryues wt all y• comuners & craftes came to y• blacke  eth well & worthely arayed to welcome our kyng with dyuers melodyes / &  hanked almyghty god of his gracyous vyctory that he shewed for hym.

And this same tyme y• erle of Warwik layde a syege vnto Dounfront & gate it / & put therin a capytayne.  And for to speke more of the erle of Marche that y• kynge ordeyned tho to scomme the see & to kepe the costes of Englonde for all maner of enemyes / the wynde arose vpon them, that they wende all to haue ben lost / but through the grace of god almyghty and good gouernaumce they tode afore the   of Wyght all y• storme. And there were lost two carackes & two balyngers with marchaumdyse & other grete goodes & all the people y• were within them. And an other caracke droue before Hamton / and threwe his mast ouer the walles of the towne / and this was on saynt Barthylmewes daye. And whan all this storme was cesed this worthy erle of Marche toke his shyppes wt his meyny / & wente to the see & londed in Normandy at Hogges / & so rode forth towarde the kyng / & euer as he came the frensshmen fledde. And there came vnto them an Anthony pygge & folowed y• hoost all y• waye tyll they came to a grete water / & there they drad to haue bendrowned / for the water closed them so y• they myght no where gete out. But at the last almyghty god   this pygge brought them out all safe   there they caught a guyde y• knewe all the countree aboute /   brought them through a   sa de / and so in to an yle / and there they   many prysoners in theyr waye toward the kynge in theyr iourney / and so they came vnto Cane. And there y• kyng welcomed him & toke his iourney to Argenten / & than anone it was yolden vnto the kyng / and they had theyr lyues & went theyr way And than our kynge remeued & went to a stronge towne that was called Cese / & there was a fayre mynster / & they yelded it anone vnto the kynge. And than the kyng went from thens to Alaunson and wanne the towne & the bridge. And the kynge sente the erle of warwyk to   towne that was called Belesme with a grete and a stronge power / & anone they yelded it / & put them all in to the kynges good grace & mercy / & so dyd many mo  stronge townes & castelles that were in those partyes. And from thens they went   in Perche / & anone it was yelded vnto the   bothe the towne & the castell / & bodyes, & goodes at the kynges good grace. And so the kyng gate & conquered all y• townes & castelles / pyles strengthes   abbeys vnto Poumt de larche & from thens vnto y• cite of Boen.  And in the fyfth yere of kyng Henryes regne the fyfth / syr Iohn Oldeastel y• was the lorde Cobham was arested for heresy / & brought to y• Coure of London / & anone after he brake the Cou e and went in to Wales / & there kepte hym  ge tyme. And at y•  he lorde Po  toke hym but he stode  grete defence longe tyme & was sore wo ded or he wolde be taken & to the lorde   man brought hym out of Wales to London   wher  & so he was brought to Westmynster / & there was examined of certayn poyntes that were  ut on   / & he sayd not nay / and so he was conuicte of the clergy for his heresy /    ned before the Justyfull   glad / & so they went forth in haste & kepte y• groumde & the place y• the kynge & his coumseyle had assigned / & they quytte them as good warryours to theyr kyng  Now wyll I tell you whiche were y• chefe capytaynes & gouernours of y• cite of Roen. Mon syr Guy butler was chefe capytayn bothe of y• cite & of the castel / & Mon syr Termegan he was capitayn of port de Caur. Mon syr de la Roche was capitayn of y• disners. Monsyr Anthony was lewtenaunt to Mon syr Guy Butler. Henry Chantfien was capytayne of the porte de la pount. Iohn Mantreuas was capytayne of the porte de la castel. Monsyr de Preaux was capytayne of the porte of saynt Hylary. The bastarde of Tyne he was capytayne of the porte Martenuylle. And graumd Iakes a worthy war  your he was capytayne of all men of warre / and he was gouernour outward bothe on horsbacke and on fote of al men of armes wham they yssued out of the cite of all y• portes he them arayed as they sholde encountre wt our meyny. And eche of the capitaynes ladde .v. M. men of armes / and some moo. And at y• fyrst comynge of our kynge there were nombred by herawdes vnto .CCC. M. of men and women and chyldren / what yonge & olde. And amonge all these was many a manfull man of his handes / & so they preued them whan they yssued out of the cite bothe on horsbacke and on fote / for they came neuer at one gate out alone / but at thre or foure gates / and at euery gate two or thre thousand of good mennes bodyes armed and manfully encountred wt our Englysshmen / & moche people slayne dyuers tymes wt gonnes / quarelles & other ordynaunce. And this syege dured .xx. wekes / and euer they of the towne trusted to haue ben res wed / but there came none. So at the last they kepte so longe the towne that there dyed many a thousande within the towne for defaute of meet of men & women & chyldren / for they had eten theyr horses / dogges and cattes that were in the towne. And oftentymes y• men of armes droue out the poore people at the gates of the towne for spendyng of vitayles / & anone ou  Englysshmen droue them in to the towne agayne. So at the last the capytayne of the towne sawe the myschefe / & that they were not rescowed / & also the scarsete of vytayle / and that the people dyed for defaute of meet euery daye many thousandes / & also sawe yonge chyldren lye lyke as they had souked theyr moders pappes and were deed. Than anone they sent to the kyng besechynge hym of his grace & mercy / and brought the keys of the towne vnto y• kyng  & de lyuered the towne to hym / & all the soudyours voyded the towne wt they horses & harneys / & the comyns of y• towne for to abyde & dwell styll in y• towne / yerely to paye to hy¯ & to his successours for all maner customes &  ee fermes & quater mes. And than the kyng entred into the towne / & rested hym in the castel tyll the towne was set in rule & in gouernaumce.  How the kyng of Englonde was made enherytour & regent of Fraunc  / and how he wedded quene Katheryne. ANd anone after that Roen was goten / Depe & many other townes in base Normandy gaue them ouer without stroke or syege whan they vnderstode y• the kyng had go e¯ Ro n. Also this yere had ben a peas made & sworne bytwene y• duke of Burgoyn & the Dolphyn / whiche were sworne on goddes body that they sholde loue & assyst  he other agaynst theyr enemyes. And after this contrary to this othe / the duke Iohn of Burgoyne was slayne and pyteously   murdred in the presence of the Dolphyn wherfore ye frensshmen were gretly deuyded / and of very necessyte laboured to haue a treaty with ye kyng of Englonde For the kyng of Englonde wanne dayly of them townes / castelles and fortresses.  Also this same yere was quene Iane arested & brought in to ye castell of Ledes in Kent. And one frere Randolf a doctour of diuinite her confessour whiche afterwarde was slayne by the persone of the Toure fallyng at wordes & debate. And after quene Iane was deliuered.  And in the .vij. yere bothe ye kynge of Fraumce and of Englonde were accorded / & kyng Henry was made heyre and regent of Fraunce / & wedded dame Katheryn the kynges doughter of Fraumce at Troyes in Champayn on Tr ite sondaye. And this was made by the meane of Philip newe made duke of Burgoyne / whiche was sworne to kyng Henry for to aue¯ge his faders deth & was become englysshe And than ye kynge with his newe wyfe went to Paris / where he was ryally receyued. And from thens he went wt his lordes & the duke of Burgoyn and many other lordes of Fraunce & layde syege to diuers townes of Fraumce that helde of ye Dolphyns party & wanne them. But ye towne of Melune helde longe tyme / for therin were good defenders.  In the viij. yere ye kyng & ye quene came ouer see & londed on Candelmasse daye in ye mornyng at Douer. And the .xiiij. day of Feueryer ye kyng came to London / & the. xxj daye of ye same moneth ye quene came / & the .xxiiij. daye of ye same she was crowned at Westmynster.  Also ye same yere anone after eester ye kyng helde a parlya ment at Westmynster / at whiche parlia ment it was ordeyned yt the golde in englysshe coyne sholde be weyed / & none receyued but by weyght.  And anone after  hytsontyde the kyng sayled to Calais & passed so forth into Fraumce. And in Marche the .xxij. daye before the kynge came ouer / ye duke of Clarence was slayne in Fraumce / & diuers other lordes taken prisoners / as the erle of Huntingdon / ye erle of Somerset wt dyuers other / & all was bycause they wold not take none arthers with them / but thought to haue ouercomen ye frensshmen themselfe without archers / & yet whan he was slayne the archers came & rescowed the body of the duke / whiche they wold haue caryed wt them / god haue mercy on his soule / he was a valyaumt man. And the same yere bytwene Chrystmasse & Ca¯delmasse the towne of Melun was yolden to ye kynge  In the .ix. yere on saynt Nicolas day in December was borne Henry y• kynges fyrst begoten sone at Wyndsore / whose godfaders at the font stone was Henry bysshop of Wynchestre / & Iohn duke of Bedford / & the duchesse of Holland was godmoder / & Henry Chicheley archebisshop of Caumterbury was godfader at co¯ firmynge.  And in the .x. yere ye cite of Meaux in Brie was goten / whiche had longe ben besyeged. And this same yere the quene shypped at Hampton & sayled ouer to the kynge in Fraumce / where she was worshipfully receyued of ye kyng / & also of the kyng of Fraumce her fader / & of her moder. And thus kyng Hery Wanne fast in Fraumce & helde grete estate / & sate at diner at a gretefeest i Paris crowned & the quene also / whiche had not be¯ seen before / & all people resorted to his courte but the kyng of Fraumce helde none estate ne rule / but was left almost alone.  Also this yere ye wethercocke was set vpon Paules steple at London. And this yere in the moneth of August ye kynge wexed seke at Boys de Vincene / & wham he sawe he sholde dye he made his testament / & ordeyned many noble thinges for his soule and deuoutly receyued al cheryghtes of   holy chirche / in so ferforth that whan he was anoynted he sayd the seruyce with the preest / & at the verse of the psalme of  iserere mei deus. that was Benigne fac dn¯e in bona volumtate tua syon: vt edifice¯tur muri hierusalem. he badde tary there and sayd thus. O good lorde / thou knowest that myn entent hath ben / & yet is / yf I might lyue to reedifye ye walles of Ierusalem. And than the preest proce ded forth & made an ende. And anone after this moost noble prince & victoryous kyng floure in his tyme of chrysten chyualry / whome all the worlde doubted / gaue his soule in to the handes of god & dyed & made an ende of his naturall lyfe at the foresayd Boys de Vince¯ne besyde Parys the .xxxvj. yere of his age / vpon whose soule god haue mercy. Amen. Than was the body enbawmed & cered & layde in a ryall chare / & an ymage lyke to hym was layde vpon the corps open with diuers baners / & horses couered ry chely wt the armes of Englo¯de & Fraumce & also the olde armes of saynt Edwarde saynt Edmond & other / with grete multytude of torches / with whome went ye kynge of Scotlond & many other lordes whiche accompanyed the body tyl it came vnto Westmynster by London in Englonde. And in euery towne by ye waye he had solempnely his Dirige on the euen and masse on the morow / & moche almes was gyue¯ to poore people by the waye. And the .vij. daye of Nouember after ye corps was brought through London wt grete reuerence and solempnite to Westmynster where as he now lyeth / it was worshipfully buryed / & after was layde on his tombe a ryal ymage lyke hymself of syluet & gylt / whiche was made at ye  ost of quene Katheryn. And thus ended and is entered & buryed the noble kynge Henry the fyfth / on whose soule and all thrysten soules god haue mercy. Amen.  Of the lawe of kyng Henry the fyfth and what he ordeyned for kyng Richard and for hymselfe after his deth. HEre is to be noted that this kynge Henry ye fyfth was a noble prynce after he was kynge & crowned / how be it before in his youth he had ben wylde recheles & spared nothynge of his lust ne desyres / but accomply hed them after his lykyng. But as soone as he was crowned / anoynted and sacred / anone sodeynly he was chaumged in to a newe ma¯ & set all his entent to lyue vertuously in maynteynynge of holy chirche / destroyenge of heretykes / kepyng Iustyce & defendyng of his realme & subgeetes. And for as moche as his fader had deposed by his labour the good kyng Rychard / & pyteously made hym to dye / & for the offence done to him agaynst his legeaunce he had sent to Rome to be assoyled therof For which offence our holy fader ye pope enioyned hym to make him to be prayed for perpetually / & lyke as he had done to be taken from hym his naturall lyfe / therfore he sholde do foumde .iiij. tapers to bren perpetually about his body that for the extynccyon of his bodyly lyfe his soule may euer be remembred & lyue in heuen in spirituall lyfe. And also ye he shold euery weke on the daye as it came about of his deth haue a sole¯pne masse of Requi  & on the euen afore a Dirige with .ix. lessons / & a dole to poore people alway on ye daye of .xj. shyllynges & .viij. pens to be deled peny mele / & ones in ye yere at his annyuersary his enterement to be holden in the moost honest wyse / & to be deled ye daye .xx. pounde in pens to poore people & to euery monke .xx. shyllynges / whiche all these thinges per ournted this noble kynge for his fader. For kyng Henry the fourth his fader perfourmed it not durynge his lyfe / whome as it was sayd   god touched and was a lepre or he dyed.  And than this noble prynce let do call all the abbottes & pryours of saynt Benettes ordre in Englonde / & had them in the chapter hous of Westmy¯ster for the reformacion of the ordre / wherin he had comynycacyon / & also with bysshops & men of the spiritualte / in so ferforth that they doubted sore ye he wolde haue had ye temporaltees out of theyr ha¯des / wherfore by the aduyse / labours & procuryng of the spiritualte encouraged the kynge for to chalenge Normandy & his ryght in Fraumce / to the entent to set hym a werke there / that he shold not seke occasyons to entre in to suche maters. And al his lyfe after he laboured in ye werres in conque ryng a grete parte of ye realme of Fraumce that by the agrement of the kyng Charles he had all the gouernaunce and rule of the realme of Fraunce / & he was proclaymed regent & heyre of Fraunce. And so notwithstandynge for all this grete warre that he had / yet he remembred his soule / and also that he was mortall and must dye / for whiche he ordeyned by his lyfe tyme the place of his sepulture where he is buryed / and there is euery daye thre masses perpetually songen in a chapell ouer his sepulture / of whiche the myddle masse and the fyrst & the last masse shall be as it is assygned by hym / as it appereth by these verses folowynge.

And yet the noble kyng Henry ye fyfth founded two houses of religyon / that one is called Syon besyde Braynford of the ordre of saynt Brigitte bothe of men and women. And on ye other syde of the riuer of Tamyse a hous of monkes of Charterhous / in whiche two places he is contynually prayed for nyght and daye / for euer whan they of Syon resteth they of the Charterhous do theyr seruyce / & in lyke wyse whan they of ye Charterhous resteth the other gothe to / and by ryngynge of the belles of eyther place eche knoweth whan they haue ended theyr seruyce / whiche be nobly endowed / & do dayly there grete almes dedes / as in the Charterhous certeyn chyldren be foumde to scole: & at Syon certeyn almes gyuen dayly. And yet besyde all this he founded a recluse whiche shall be alway a preest to praye for him by ye sayd Charterhous which preest is sufficiently endowed for hy¯ & a seruaumt. Loo here may all pry¯ces take ensample by this noble prynce that regned so lytell tyme / not fully .x. yere / & dyd so many noble actes as well for his soule to be perpetually prayed for / as in his worldly conquestes / & he beynge in his most lusti age despised & eschewed synne & was a grete iusticer / in so moche yt al ye prynces of christendom drad hym & also of     &  e   in him  fe yf god   to haue watred o  y¯   &   to knowe the ay  of other   & all y¯ passages in ye iourn   nyght of   named syr Hugh de L  vnto Ieru sall / but or he  etur  he dyed at Boy  de   in the .xxxvj. yere of his age on whose soul  Ie  haue mercy. Amen.  the .v. was pope whan Eugeny was deposed .ix. yere. This Felix was   of Sauoye   prynce & an olde man / and he sawe his childes childe. This man wham he lyued an holy lyfe was chosen pope of the concyle of Basyle / & Eugeny was deposed / & there was stryfe longetyme / & he had no grete obedyence for the deposicyon of Eugeny. And at ye last Eugeny decessed & than Felix resygned to Nycolas for fauour of peas to be had / & he was made legate of fraumce & cardynall of Sabian{us}  This was the .xxiij.   bytwene Eugeny &   / & i   . xv . y¯ere / & this was a newe cause &   seen before / for ye concyle of Basyle deposed Eugeny ye very pope / & the e was no more for he obeyed not the de rees of the concyle of Constantynople as they sayd / ne he charged not to obey the concyle of Basyle / but he sayd rather ye contrary sholde be done than so as they d r ed. Wherfore there arose a grete altercacyon in ye mater. For some sayd one waye / & some another / & coude not accorde vnto this daye / for yt one partye sayd ye the concyle was aboue the pope / & an other partye sayd ye contrary / ye the pope was aboue ye concyle / but they lefte it vndetermyned / & therfore god must dyspose for the best.  Albert was emperour after Sygysmonde one yere. This Albert was duke of Austre & neuewe to Sygysmonde / & therfore he was kynge of  em and of Vngry for his doughter / for other heyre he left none. This man was emperour of Almayne / but anone he was poysoned & dyed / and he was in all thynges a vertuous man / yt all men said he was a president to all kynges.  Fredericus y• thyrde was emperour after hym. This Frederyk was duke of Osteryke / & chosen Emperour of Almayne / but it was longe or he was crowned of the pope for diuision. At the last there was made an vnite / & he was crowned with grete honour of the pope in ye cite / & was a peasy ble man & a quyete / & of synguler pit  / & he hated not the clergye / he wedded the ky¯ges doughter of Portyngale / & in his tyme whyles that he regned he made a grete co¯uocacyon of prynces in Ra sp na / for ye incours of ye Turkes / & shewed vnto them yt now within this .xx. yere chryste¯dome was made lesse. ij .C. myle & he warned them yt they sholde be redy to resyst hym. And the imperyall cite of Constantynople was taken ye same tyme of y• mis yleuynge Turkes / & betrayed by a Ianuens / whome for his labour ye Turke made a kyng as he {pro}mysed b  / & the fourth day he called hym / & dyd d  hange hy¯ for his deceyt to his mayster. And there was grete sorowe & wepyng amonge ye chrysten people for ye losse of yt noble cite / for many a christen man was slayne / & innumerable were sold / & ye emperour was slayne / & for enuy ye Turke caused his heed to be smytten of wham he was deed / & almoost al ye fayth in ye lo¯de of greke fayled.  Nycolas the .v. a Ia nuens was pope after Felix .viij. yere. This Nycolas was chosen at Rome in the place of Eugeny: & yet y• strife henge styll / & a lytell & a lytel they obeyed hym And al men meruayled that a man of so poore a nacyon shold obtayne agaynst y• duke of Sauoye ye whiche was cosyn & alyed almoost to all the prynces of chry endome   & euerychdue left hym. Than in the yere after there was a peas made & Felix resygned / for it pleased our lorde his name to be gloryfyed by an obiect of the worlde as was y• Ianuens in comparyson to the duke the pope. This Nycolas was a mayster in diuinite and an actyfe man / & a ryche man in conceytes and many thynges that were fallen he buylded agayn / & all y• walles of Rome he renewed for drede of the Turke. And there was a verse made of this vnite / & publysshed in the cite.  ux fud sit mun dot cessit Felix Nicolao. And that in the yere of our lorde. M .CCCC .xlix. The yere of grace with a grete deuocyon was confermed / & innumerable people went to the apostles setes.  How kynge Henry the syxth regned beynge a chylde not one yere of age / and of the batayle of Vernoyle in Perche. AFter king Henry y• fyfth regned Henry his sone but a childe / and not fully one yere of age / whose regne began the fyrst daye of September in y• yere of our lord. M .cccc .xxij. This kyng beynge in his cradell was moche doubted & drad bycause of the grete conquest of his fader / & also the wysdome & guydyng of his vncles the duke of Bedford and the duke of Glocestre.  This yere the .xxi. daye of October dyed Charles the kynge of Fraumce / & lyeth buryed at saynt Denys. And than was y• duke of Bedford made regent of Fraumce. And y• duke of Glocestre was made protectour & defendour of Englonde.  And y• fyrst daye of Marche after was syr William Tayllour preest degraded of his preesthode / & on y• morowe after he was brent in smythfelde for heresye.  This yere syr Iames Stewarde kynge of scottes maryed dame Iane the duchesse dough te  of Clayence whiche   by he  fyrst hus  the erle   a  saynt Mary   yere the .xvij. da e   of  rnoyle   of Bedford regent of   & the duke of  Alaunson whiche was a grete batayle. The duke of   his  syde the erle of   & the lorde Talbot & all the power y• they coude ma  kepte. And also many   with moche people of th  duke  yns And on th  was the duke of Alaumson / the duke of   the erle of Douglas   ha  / wt many lordes of Fraumce / & a grete company of scottes & armynackes. And than y• erle Douglas called y• duke of Bedforde in scorne Iohn wt the leden swerde. And he sente hym worde agayne y• he sholde fynde y• daye y• his swerde was of style. And so y•  yned on bothe sydes & fought   me y• no man wyst who sholde haue y• better a grete whyle / but at y• last as god wold y• victory fell vnto y• englysshe party / for there were slayne the erle Douglas whiche a lyteil before was made duke of Turo¯ / y• erle of Bou gha¯ / y• erle of Almarre / y• erle of Tounar the erle of Vaumtedor / & y• vycoumte of Ner bonne / whiche was one of them y• slewe duke Iohn of Burgoyn knelyng before the Dolphyn / & many m  vnto y• nombre of .x. M. & moo. And there was taken prysoners y• duke of Alaumson and many other lordes & gentylle  of Fraumce / but scottes y• daye were slayne downe right the substaumce of them all.  The thyrde yere of kynge Henry the syxth the duke, of Glocestre maryed the duchesse of Hollande / and went ouer see with her in to Henaud for to take possessyon of his wy ues enherytaumce / where he was honou rably receyued and taken for lord of the   londe. But soone after he was fayne to returne home agayne in to Englonde / & lefte his wyfe & all his tresour y• he had brought wt hym in a town that is called Mouns in Henaud / whiche promysed for to be true to hym. Notwithsta¯dyng they delyuered the lady vnto y• duke of Burgoyn / whiche sent her to Gaunt / & from thens she escaped in a ma¯nes clothy¯ge & came in to zelande to a towne of her owne called Sirixze / & from thens she wente to a towne in Hollande called the Gowe / & there she was stronge ynough and withstode y• foresayd duke of Burgoyne.  And soone after y• duke of Glocestre sent ouer see in to zelande the  lord  Fitz water with certayn men of warre and archers for to helpe & socour y• foresayd duchesse of Hollande / whiche londed at a place in zelande called Brewers hauen / where the lordes of y• coumtree came downe & fought with hym / & in conclusyon he was fayne to withdrawe hym & his company to y• see agayne. But yet he slewe & hurte dyuers lordes & moche people of the same coumtree / & so returned home agayn in to Englonde wt his company / & preuayled no thynge.  And also this same yere y• erle of Salesbury / y• erle of Suffolke / y• lorde Wyllybe / & the lorde Scales with theyr retynue layde syege to the cyte of Mauns / the whiche cyte was yolden to them wt many other stronge townes & castels to y• nombre of xxxvj.  This tyme all Normandy & a grete parte of Fraunce vnto Drlyaunce was vnder the obeyssaumce of y• kynge of Englonde / & all the remenaumt of Fraumce was in grete trybulacyon & myschefe.  How there was lyke to haue ben a grete fraye bytwene the cardynal and the duke of Glocestre. And of the coronacyon of kyng Henry the syxth bothe in Englonde and in Fraunce. IN the fourth yere y• same nyght y• the mayre of London Iohn Couentre had taken his charge / was a grete watche in London for a fraye that was bytwene y• bysshop of Wynchestre & the duke of Glocestre protectour.  &c.  For the mayre wt the people of y• cite wold abyde by the duke of Glocestre as protectour & defendour of y• realme. But by labour of lordes that went bytwene / & in especyal by the labour of y• prynce of Portyngale there was a poyntement taken y• there was no harme done.  And after y• batayle of Vernoyle in Perche the duke of Bedford came ouer in to Englonde. And on whytsonday this same yere at Leycestre he dubbed kynge Henry knyght. And forth with y• sayd kyng Henry dubbed all these knyghtes whose names foloweth / y• is to wyte / syr Rycharde duke of Yorke / also y• sone & heyre of y• duke of Norfolke / the erle of Oxford / the erle of westmerlonde / the sone & heyre of y• erle of  Northumberlond  / y• sone & heyre of y• erle of Vrmond / y• lord Roos / syr Iames butteler / the lord Matrauas / syr Henry gray of Tankeruile / syr William Neuyl /  lord  Fawconbrygge / syr George Neuyl lorde Latymer / the lorde welles y• lorde Berkle / y• sone & heyre of y•  lord  Talbot / syr Rafe gray of werk / syr Robert  eer / syr Rychard gray / syr Edmond Honger ford / syr Robert winkfeld / syr Iohn but ler / syr Raynold Cobha¯ / syr Iohn pashley / syr Thomas Tunstal / syr Iohn chi diok / syr Rafe langford / syr willia¯ drury syr william ap Thomas / syr Rycharde Carbonell / syr Rycharde wydeuyle / syr Iohn shridelow / syr William cheyn / syr William babyngton / syr Iohn tune / syr Gylbert Beauchamp.  Also in the .v. yere the duke of Bedford wt the duchesse his wyfe wente ouer see to Calays / & a lytel before went ouer Henry bysshop of wynchestre. And on our lady daye Annumciacion   in our lady chirche at Calays the bysshop of Wynchestre whan y• he had songen masse was made Cardinall and he knelynge before the hygh awter the duke of Bedford set y• hatte vpon his heed / & there were his bulles redde / as well of his charge as of the reioycynge of his benefyces spirytuall & temporall.  And this same yere was grete haboum daumce of rayne / that the substaumce of hey & also of corne was destroyed / for it rayned almost euery other day.  And this same yere y• good erle of Salysbury syr Thomas Montague layde syege vnto Orlyaumce / at whiche syege he was slay ne with a gonne y• came out of y• towne / on whose soule god haue mercy / for syth that he was slayne englisshe men neuer gate ne preuayled in Fraunce / but euer after began to lese lytell & lytell / tyll all was lost.  Also this same yere a Bryton murdred a good wydowe in her bed without Algate / whiche wydowe foumde hym for almes / & he bare awaye all that she had. And after this he toke the gyrth of holy chirche at saynt Georges in south warke / & there toke the crosse & forsware this londe. And as he went it happened y• he came by the place where he dyd this cursed dede in y• subbarbes of London / & the women of the same parysshe came out with staues and canell dung & slewe & made an ende of hy¯ there Notwithstandynge y• constables & many other men beynge present for to kepe hym / for there were many women and had no pyte.  Also this same yere the duke of Norfolke wt many gentylmen & yemen toke his barge the .viij. daye of Nouember at saynt Mary auerays for to haue gone through London brydge / & through mysguydyng of the barge / it ouerthrewe on y• pyles / and many men were drowned / but y• duke hy¯self wt two or thre lept vpon y• piles & so were saued with helpe of men that were aboue the brydge with castynge downe ropes / by the whiche ropes they saued themselfe.  This same yere on saynt Leonardes daye kyng Henry beynge .vij. yere olde was crowned at westminster / at whose crownacyon were made .xxxvj. knyghtes This yere on saynt Georges day he passed ouer y• see to Calays toward Fraumce  Aboute this tyme & afore the realme beynge in grete mysery & trybulacyon / the Dolphyn wt his party began to make warre & gate certayn places / & made distresses vpon englyshmen by y• meane of his capytayns / y• is to saye / la Heer & Poton de seyntraylles / & in especyall a mayde whiche they named la pucelle de dieu. This mayde rode lyke a man / and was a valyaumt capitayn amonge them & toke vpon her many grete enterprises in so moche y• they had a byleue for to haue recouered all theyr losses by her. Notwithsta¯dyng at y• last after many grete feates / by y• helpe & prowesse of syr Iohn Luxemburgh whiche was a noble capytayn of y• duke of Burgoyns & many englysshe men pycardes & burgonyons whiche were of our party before y• towne of Compyne the .xxiij. daye of Maye the foresayd pucelle was taken in y• felde armed lyke a man / & many other capytayns wt her / & were all brought to Roen & there she was put i pryson / & there she was iudged by y• lawe to be brent. And than she sayd y• she was wt childe / wher by she was respyted a whyle. But in co¯ clusyon it was foumde y• she was not with chylde / & than she was brent in Roen / & the other capitayns were put to raumson & entreated as men of warre ben acustomed.  And this same yere about Candelmasse Richard hunder a woll packer was dampned for an heretike & brent at Toure hyll.  And aboute mydlent syr Thomas Baggeley preest & vycarye of   Mauen in Essex besyde walden was disgraded & da¯pned for an heretyke & brent in smythfelde.  And also in y• same yere whyles the kynge was in Fraumce there were many heretykes & loulars y• had purposed to make a risyng / & cast bylles in many places. But blyssed be god the capytayne of them was taken / whose name was William Maumdeuyll a weuer of Abyndon & baylyf of the same towne whiche named himselfe Iacke Sharp of wigmoreslonde in wales. And afterwarde he was byheded at the foresayd Abyndon in the whytsone weke on the tewesday.  This same yere y• .vj. daye of December kynge Henry the .vj. was crowned kyng of Fraumce at Parys in y• chirche of our lady wt grete solempnite / there beynge present the Cardynall of Englonde / the duke of Bedford / & many other lordes of Fraunce & of Englonde. And after this crownacyon & grete feest holden at Parys / the kyng returned from thens to Roen / & so towarde Calays / & the .ix. daye of February lo¯ded at Douer whome all the comyns of Kent mette at beramdoun bytwene Caumterbury & Douer all in reed hodes / & so came forth tyll he came to y• blacke heth / where he was mette with the Mayre Iohn welles wt all the craftes of London / clothed all in whyte / & so they brought hy¯ vnto London the .xxj. daye of the same moneth.  And this same yere was a restraynt of the wolles of Calays made by y• soudyours / bycause they were not payed of theyr wages / wherfore y• duke of Bedford regent of Fraumce beynge than capytayne came to Calays the tewesdaye in the eester weke. And on the morowe after many soudyours of the towne were arested & put in to warde. And in y• same weke he rode to Terewyn / and by the meane of y• bysshop of Terewyn he wedded the erles doughter of saynt Poule / & came agayne to Calays.  And the .xj. baye of Iune on saynt Barnabees daye there were foure soudyours of Calays that were chefe causers of the restraynt heded / that is to wyte / Iohn Maddeley Iohn Lunday / Thomas Palmer / and Thomas Talbot / & an hondred and .x. banysshed the towne that same tyme / and before were banysshed an hondred and .xx. soudyours. And on mydsomer euen after came the lord regent and his wyfe to London. ABoute this tyme pope Martyn dyed / & after hym Eugenye the fourth was pope. This ma¯ was prasybly chosen in Rome by the Cardynalles and was very & indubytate pope. But shortly after he was put & erpulsed out of Rome / in suche maner that he was fayne to flee naked. In this same tyme was the concyle of Basylye / to whiche concyle he was tho cyted to come. And bycause he came not / they deposed hym But he rought not ne set not therby but gate the cyte of Rome & abode styll pope xvij. yere.  This yere about whycson tyde the heretykes of Praghe were destroyed. For at two Iourueys were destroyed of them moo than .xxij. M. with theyr capitaynes / that is to wyce Procapius / Saplico / and Lupus presbyter Also there was taken on lyue mayster Peers clarke an englyshman & an heretyke.  Also this same yere was a grete frost & a stronge durynge .xj. wekes for it began on saynt Katheryns euen and lasted vnto saynt Scolasticaes daye in February. In whiche tyme y• vyntage that came fro Burdeur came on shoters hyll.  This yere was the counseyle of Arras / and a grete trayte bytwene the kyng of Englonde & the kyng of Fraumce where was assembled many grete lordes of bothe partyes / at whiche counseyle   was offred to ye kyng of Englonde grete thynges / by the meane of a legate that came fro Rome whiche was cardynall of saynt crosse / whiche offers were refused by the Cardynall of Englonde & other lordes that were there for ye kyng Wherfore ye duke of Burgoyne whiche longe had ben englysshe sworne / forsoke our partye and returned frensshe by the meane of the foresayd legate / & made a peas with ye frensshe kyng / receyuynge of the kyng for recompensynge of his faders deth ye coumte of po tou / the lordshyp of Macon / with moche other as is specyfyed in the sayd treaty. And so our embassadours came home agayn in worse case than they wente out. For they lost there the duke of Burgoyn whiche had ben with his burgonyons & picardes a synguler helpe in all ye conquest of Normandy & of Fraumce.  This same yere was a grete batayle on the see bytwene the Ienewes & the kynge of Aragon / of whiche batayle yt Ienewes had ye victory / for they toke ye kynge of Aragon / the kynge of Nauerne / & the grete mayster of saynt Iames in Galyse / with. iij .C. knyghtes & squyers & moche other people. And this was on saynt Dominyks daye.  And this same yere were seen thre sonnes at ones / & anone folowed ye threfolde gouernaumce in ye chirche / that is to wyte / of Eugeny / of the concyle / and of neutralite.  Also this same yere M .CCCC .xxxiiij. was a passing grete wynde / by whiche steples / houses / and trees were ouerthrowen.  About this tyme was an holy mayde in Holland called Lidwith / whiche lyued onely by myracle / not etyng ony meet.  This yere the duke of Burgoyn began his ordre at Lyle of the golden Flees / & ordeyned certayne knyghtes of ye same ordre / & made statutes & ordynaumces moche according vnto the ordre of the garter.  Also this same yere the frenshmen had enterprysed to haue stolen Calays in ye fysshinge tyme / for many botes of fraumce had safe condytes to come to Calays for to take herynge. And the soudyours of ye towne had a custom to come to ye chirche & leue theyr staues standyng at ye chirche dore whiche staues the frenshment that were arayed lyke fisshers had purposed to haue taken / and so for to haue wonne the towne / but one of them laye with a comyn woman ye nyght before / & he tolde to her theyr counseyle. And she on yt morowe tolde it to the lewtenaunt / whiche forth with commaumded yt euery man shold kepe his wepen in his hande / sakeryng tyme and other. And whan the frensshe men {per}ceyued this that they were myspoynted / they sayled streyght to Depe / and stale and toke that towne.  And on Newyeres euen after they toke Harflet And thus the englyshmen began to lese a lytell and a lytell in Normandye.  How Calays & Guynes were besyeged by ye duke of Burgoyn / & how they were rescowed by ye duke of Glocestre. THis yere through all Englonde was a grete noyse how the duke of Burgoyne  wold  come & besyege Calays / wherfore ye erle of Mortayn with his army yt he had for to haue gone wt in to fraumce was contremaumded & charged that he shold go to Calays / whiche was at that tyme well vitayled & manned / for syr Iohn Ratclife was lewtenaumt of the kyng in ye towne / & the baron of Dudley lewtenaumt of the castel. And the .ix. daye of Iuly the duke of Burgoyn with all ye power of flaumdres & moche other people came before Calays / and set his syege about the towne / & euery towne of flaumdres had theyr tentes by themselfe. And this syege endured thre wekes. In the   meane whyle the duke of Glocestre beynge {pro}tectour of englonde toke ye moost parte of the lordes of englond and went ouer the see to Calays for to rescowe the towne / or to fyght with the duke & his hoost yf they wolde abyde. This tyme London & euery good towne in englond sent ouer the see to this rescowe certayn people well arayed of the best & chosen men for the warre. And the seconde day of August the foresaid duke of Glocestre arryued at Calays with all his armye and .v. hondred shyppes & mo . And the duke of Burgoyne & all his hoost yt laye in the syege / as soone as they espyed the sayles in the see / before they approched Calays hauen / sodeynly in a mornynge departed from ye syege / leuyng behynde hym moche stuffe & vytayle / and fledde in to flaundres & pycardye. And in lyke wyse dyd the syege yt lay before Guynes where as they of Guynes toke the grete gonne of brasse called Dygeon / & many other grete gonnes & serpentynes. And whan the duke of Glocestre was arryued wt all his hoost / he went in to flaundres / and was there .xij. dayes and dyd but lytell harme / excepte that he brent two fayre vyllages Poperynge & Belle and other houses whiche were of noo strength / & so he returned home agayne  And this same yere ye kynge of Scotlo¯de besyeged Rokesburgh with moche people. But syr Rafe Gray departed from the castel and ordeyned for rescowe. But as soone as the kynge of Scotlonde vnderstode of his departynge / sodeynly he brake his syege & went his waye / and lefte moche ordynaunce behynde hym / where he gate no worshyp.  In this same yere the seconde daye of Ianuary quene Katherin whiche was ye kynges moder & wyfe to kynge Henry the fyfth dyed & departed out of this worlde / and was brought ryally through London / and so to westmynster / & there she lyeth worshipfully buryed in our ladyes thapell.  Also this yere the fourth daye of Ianuary fell downe the gate with the toure on it on London brydge towarde Southwarke with two arches & all yt stode theron.  This same yere was a grete treaty holden bytwene Graueling & Calays bytwene the kyng & the duke of Burgoyn / where for the kyng was ye Cardinall of Englonde / the duke of Norfolke / & many other lordes. And for the duke of Burgoyn was the duches e hauynge full power of her lorde as regent & lady of his londes / where was taken by the aduyse of bothe partyes an abstinence of warre for a certayne tyme in ye name of ye duchesse & not of the duke bycause he had gone from his othe & legeaumce that he had made to kynge Henry / therfore the kyng neuer  wold  wryte no appoynt to haue to do with hym after but all in the duchesse name.  Also this same yere quene Iane dyed the seconde daye of Iuly / whiche had ben wyse to kynge Henry the fourth / & was caryed fro Bermondsey to Caumterbury where she lyeth buryed by kyng Henry her husbonde.  This same yere dyed all ye lyons in the Toure of London the whiche had not ben seen many yeres before.  How Owen a squyer of wales yt had wedded quene Katherin was arested & of the scysme bytwene Eugeny & Feli . IN the .xvi. yere of kynge Henry dyed Sygysmonde Emperour of Almayn & knyght of the garter / whose enterement ye kyng kept at saynt Paules in London ryally / where was made a ryall herse / and the kynge in his estate cladde in blewe was a  euen at Dirige & on ye morow at masse. & .  And after hym was electe & chosen Albert duke of   Ostryche whiche had wedded Sygismondes doughter for to be Emperour. This man was taken & receyued to be kyng of Beme and Hungary bycause of his wyfe yt was Sygismondes doughter / whiche lefte none other heyre after hym. This Albert was emperour but one yere / for he was poysoned / & so dyed Some saye he dyed of a flix / but he was a vertuous man & piteful / so moche yt all the people that knewe hym sayd that ye worlde was not worthy to haue his presence.  This yere one Owen a squyer of wales a man of lowe byrth (whiche had many a day before secretly wedded quene Katheryn / & had by her .iij. sones & one doughter) was taken & commaumded to Newgate to pryson by ye duke of Glocestre {pro}tectour of the realme. And this yere he brake the prison by the meane of a preest that was his chapelayn / & after was taken agayn by my lorde Bemond & brought agayne to Newgate / & afterward delyuered at large / & one of his sones afterward was made erle of Rychemond / & an other erle of Penbroke / & the thyrde a monke of westminster / whiche monke dyed soone after.  This same yere also on Newyeres day at Baynardes castell fell downe a stake of wode sodeynly at after none and slewe thre men myscheuously / & foule hurt other.  Also at  Bedford  on a sherthursdaye were xviij. men murdred wtout stroke by fallyng downe of a stayre as they came out of ye comin hall / & many sore hurt.  In the .xviij. yere syr Richard Beauchamp the good erle of warwyke dyed at Roen he beynge ye tyme lewtenaumt of ye kynge in Normandy / & from thens his body was brought to warwyke / where worshypfully he lyeth in a new chapel on ye south syde of ye quere.  Also this yere was a grete derth of corne in all englonde / for a busshel of where was worth .xl. pens in many places of englond / & yet had they not ynough / wherfore Steuen Brown that tyme Mayre of London sente in to Pruce and brought to London certayne shippes laden wt rye / whiche did moche good to ye poore people / for corne was so scarce in englo¯de yt in some places of englonde poore people made them breed of ferne rotes.  This yere ye generall concyle of Basilie deposed Eugenye / & they chose Felix yt was duke of Sauoy / & than began ye scysme whiche endured vnto ye yere of our  lord.  M .cccc .xlviij. This Felix was a deuout pry¯ce & sawe his sones sone / & after lyued an holy lyf / and was chosen pope of ye concyle of Basile / & Eugeny deposed. And so ye scysme was lo¯ge tyme / & this Felix had but lytel obedience bycause of ye neutralite / for ye moost part & wel nygh all christendom obeyed & reputed Eugeny for very pope: god knoweth who was very pope of them bothe / for bothe occupyed during Eugenyes lyfe.  This yere syr Richard wyche vicare of Hermete sworth was degraded of his preesthode at Paules & brent at tour hill as for an heretyke / on saynt Botulphes day / how wel at his deth he died a good christen ma¯ / wherfore after his deth moche peple came to ye place where he was brent & offred & made a hepe of stones / & set vp a crosse oftre & held hy¯ for a saynt tyl ye mayr & shreues by ye ky¯ges commaumdement & bysshops destroyed it / & made there a dung hil.  Also this yere ye shreues of London fet out of say¯t Martyns ye grand .v. {per}sones / which afterward were restored agayn to ye sentwary by ye kynges Iustyces.  After Albert ye thyrde Frederyk was chosen emperour. This Frederyk duke of Osteryke was longe emperour / & dyfferred to be crowned at Rome bycause of the scysme / but after ye vnite was had / he was crowned wt the imperyall dyademe with grete glory &   triumphe of pope Nicolas ye fourth. This was a peasyble ma¯ / quyete & of singuler pacience / not hatyng ye chirche / he wedded ye kynge of Portyngales doughter.  How the duchesse of Glocestre was arested for treason / & commytted to perpetuall pryson in the yle of Man / & of the deth of mayster Roger Bolyngbroke. IN this yere Elenore Cobham duchesse of Glocestre was arested for certayn poyntes of treason layd agaynst her / where vpon she was examyned in saint Stephens chapel at westmynster before ye archebysshop of Caumterbury / & there she was enioyned to open penaumce for to go through chepe berynge a taper in her hande / & after to perpetual prison in the yle of Man / vnder the kepynge of syr Thomas stanley. Also yt same tyme was arested mayster Thomas Southwell a chanon of westmynster / mayster Iohn Hume a chapelayn of the sayd lady / mayster Roger Bolyngbroke a clarke vsyng nygromancy / & one Margery iourdemayn called ye wytche of Eye besyde westmynster. These were arested as for beynge of coumseyle wt the sayd duchesse of Glocestre. And as for mayster Thomas southwell he dyed in ye Toure the nyght before he sholde haue ben reyned on ye morow. For he hymselfe sayd yt he sholde dye in his bedde / & not by iustyces. And in the .xx. yere mayster Iohn Hume and mayster Roger Bolingbroke were brought to ye gylde hall in London & there before ye Mayre ye lordes & the e Iustyces of Englonde were reyned and dampned bothe to be drawen hanged & quartred / but mayster Iohn Hume had his chartre & was pardoned by ye kyng / but mayster Roger was drawen to Tyburne / where he confessed yt he dyed gyltles / and neuer had trespaced in that he dyed for. Notwithsta¯dyng he was hanged heded and quartred / on whose soule god haue mercy. And Margery iourdemayn was brent in smythfelde.  Also this yere was a grete fraye in London in Flete strete by nyght tyme / bytwene men of courte & men of London / and dyuers men slayne & some hurt / & one Herbotell was chefe causer of ye mysgouernaunce & fraye.  Also this yere at chosynge of ye Mayre of London the comyns named Roberte Clopton & Raulyn Hollande tayllour. And ye aldermen toke Robert Clopton & brought hym at ye ryght hande of ye Mayre as ye custome is. And than certayne tayllours & other hande crafty men cryed nay nay not this man but Raulyn Holland / wherfore y• Mayre that was Padysly sent them yt so tryed to Newgate / where they abode a grete whyle and were punysshed.  In this same yere were dyuers embassadours sente in to Guyan for a maryage for the kynge for ye erles doughter of Armyna  the whiche was concluded / but by the meanes of ye erle of Suffolk it was let & put aparte. And after this ye sayd erle of Suffolk went ouer see in to Fraunce & there he treated ye mariage bytwene the kynge of Englo¯de & ye kynges doughter of Cecyle & of Iherusalem. And ye neere yere that mariage was fully concluded by whiche maryage the kyng sholde delyuer to her fader the duchy of Ang o & the erledom of Mayne whiche was the key of Normandy.

And on Candelmasse euen before by a grete   tempest of thondre & lyghtnynge at after none Paules steple was set on fyre in the myddes of y• shafte in the tymbre / whiche was quenched by force of labour & specyally by y• morowmasse preest of y• Bowe in chepe / whiche was thought impossyble / saue onely the grace of god.  This yere was y• erle of Stafford made & create duke of Buckyngham / y• erle of warwyk duke of warwyk / the erle of dorset markys of dorset / & ye erle of Suffolke was made markys of Suffolke.  How kynge Henry wedded quene Margarete / & of her crownacyon. THis yere kyng Henry maryed at South wyk quene Margarete / and she came to London the .xviij. daye of Maye / & by the waye all the lordes of Englonde receyued her worshipfully in dyuers places / & in especyal the duke of Glocestre / & on the blacke heth ye mayre with the aldermen / and all ye craftes in blewe gownes browdred with ye deuyse of theyr crafte / yt they might be knowen mette with her wt reed hodes & brought her to London / where were dyuers pagentes & countenaumces of dyuers hystoryes / shewed in dyuers places of ye cyte ryally and costly.  And the .xxx. day of Maye the foresayd quene was crowned at westmynster. And there was Justes thre dayes durynge within ye sentwary before the abbey.  This yere ye pryour of Kylmayn appeled ye erle of  Vrmond  of treason / whiche had a daye assygned to them for to fyght in smythfelde / & the lystes were made and the felde dressed. But whan it came to poynt / the kynge commaunded yt they sholde not fyght / but toke ye quarell in to his hande. And this was done at the instaumce & labour of certayne prechours & doctours of London as mayster Gylbert worthyngton persone of saynt Andrewes in holborne and other.  Also this yere came a grete em bassadour in to Englonde out of Fraumce for to haue concluded a perpetuall peas but in co¯clusyon it turned vnto a trewse of a yere.  About this tyme dyed saynt Barnardyn a gray frere / whiche began the newe reformacyon of y• ordre in many places / in so moche that they yt were reformed ben called Obseruantes / whiche Obserua¯tes ben gretly encreaced in ytalye & in Almayne.

Ioh¯es de Capistrano was his dyseyple / whiche {pro}fyted moche to ye reformacyon of y• ordre / for whome god hath shewed many a fayre myracle.  Also here is to be noted y• from this tyme forwarde kyng Henry neuer profyted ne went forward but fortune began to turne from him on all sydes / as well in Fraumce / Normandy / Guyen / as in Englond. Some men holde opynyon that kynge Henry gaue commyssyon plenarly to syr Edwarde Hull / syr Robert Roos dene of saynt Seuerynes / & other / to conclude a maryage for hym with y• erle of Armynakes syster / whiche was {pro}mysed as it was sayd & concluded / but afterward it was broken & he wedded quene Margarete as afore is sayd / whiche was a dere maryage for the realme of Englonde. For it was knowe¯ veryly that for to haue her was delyuered the duchy of Angeo & the erle dom of Mayne / whiche was the key of Normandy for the frensshmen to entre. And about this y• sayd Markys of Suffolke asked in playne parlament a .xv. & an halfe to fetche her out of fraumce. Loo what a mariage was this / as to y• comparison of ye other mariage of Armynak For there shold haue be¯ delyuered so many castels & townes in Guyan / & so moche golde shold haue ben gyuen wt her / y• all englonde shold haue ben therby enry     / but   fell / wherfore   ought   bycause of   /   for maryage of    rets w    hath   englo¯de had / by losyng of Normandy & Guyan /    nge of   agaynst theyr pry    lordes / what   lordes / what murdre & sleynge of them / what feldes   &   many y•   a man hath   his   /   co¯clucyon y• kyng de   / & the quene wther sone  yne to   in to Scotland / & from thens in to Fraumce / & so to   y• she came fyrst fro. Many men dem  that the brekynge of ye kynges promesse to the syster of ye erle of Armynak was cause of his grete losse & aduersite.  How the duke of Glocestre the kynges vncle was arested at ye parlyament of Bury / & of his deth / and how Angeo and Mayne was delyuered.

To whiche parlyament came the duke of Glorestre Vmfrey the Kynges vncle whiche had ben pro etour of englonde all the noneage of ye kyng. And a    ter as he was in his lod  was arested by y• vycoumte be  of englond / who me act   y• duke of Buckyngham / & m    lordes. And forthwt all his ser es were commaumded to departe from him / &. xxxi . of y• chefe of them were a  sent to dyuers pry  / &   after this say  arest y• sayd duke was on y•   on whose soule god haute mercy. But how he dyed & in what maner th taynte is not knowe¯ / some sayd he dyed for sorowe / some sayd he was murdred bytwene two feder beddes / some sayd y• a spytte was put in his foumdament / but how he dyed god knoweth / to whom no thynge is hyd. And thus deed he was layde open yt all men myght se him / & so bothe lordes & knightes of y• shyre with burgeyses came   sawe hy¯ lye deed / but woumdene token coude they not perceyue how he dyed. Here may m  marke what this worlde is. This duke was a noble man & a grete clerke / & ruled worshypfully y• realme to ye Kynges behofe / & neuer coude be foumde faute in hy¯ / but  uy of them yt were gouernours & had {pro}my sed ye duth y of Angeo & the  dome of Mayne causen ye destruccyon of this noble man / for they drad yt he wolde haue empesshed y• delyueraunce / & after they sent his body to saint Albons wt certayn lyghtes to be buryed / & so syr Ge ays of Clefton had than ye charge to co¯uay y• corps / & so it was buryed at saynt Albons in the abbey. And fyue persones of his housholde were sente to London / & there were they reyned & Iudged to be drawen & hanged and also quartred. Of whom y• names were / syr Roger chamberlayn a knyght / Mydelton a squyer / Herbard a squyer / Arthur a squier / & Richarde Nedha¯ / whiche .v. {pro}sones were drawe¯ fro ye toure of London through che pe to tyburne / & there  a¯ged & let downe quycke / & than stryped to haue b heded & quarted / & than y• Markys of Suffolke she wed there for them y• kynges pardon vnder his grete seal  so they were pardoned of the remenaumt of the execucyon / & had theyr lyues / & so they were brought agayne to London / and after frely deliuer to. Thus began grete trouble in this realme of Englonde for the deth of this noble duke of Glocestre / and   an the comyns of y• realme began for to murmure for it / and were not content.  After ye pope Eugeny was deed Nycolas the .v. was electe pope. This Nycolas was chosen for Eugeny yet hangynge ye  eysme / notwtstandyng he gate the obedyence of all chryste¯ realmes / for after he was electe and sacred pope / certayn lordes of fraumce & of englonde were scut in to Sauoy to pope Felix / for to entreate hym to sease of ye pap ry. And by the specyall labour of y• bysshop of Norwyche and the lorde of saynt Iohns he seased y• seconde yere after y• pope Nycolas was sacred / & y• sayd Felix was ma de legate of fraumce & cardynal of Sauoy And he resygned y• hole papa y to Nycolas / & after lyued an holy lyfe & dyed an holy man / & as it is sayd almyghty god sheweth myracles for him. This was y• xxiij. scysme bytwene Eugeny & Felix / & dured .xvj. yere. The cause was this / ye generall concyle of Basyle deposed Eugeny whiche was onely pope & induby tate / for as moche as he obserued not & kept ye decrees & statutes of ye concyle of Constance / as it is sayd before / neyther he cought not to gyue obedyence to ye generall concyle in no maner wyse / wherfore arose a grete alteracion amo¯ge wryters of this mater (pro et contra) whiche can not accorde vnto this day / one party sayth yt the concyle is aboue ye pope / & y• other party sayth nay / but ye pope is aboue y• co¯cyle. God blissed aboue al thy¯ge gyue & graumte his peas in holy chirche spouse of Chryst. Amen. This Nicolas was of Iene comen of lowe degree / a doctour of d te / an actyf man / he reed fyed many places y• were broken & ruynous / & dyd do make a wall about y• palays / & made y• wall newe about Rome for drede of y• turkes. And y• people won   gretly meruayled of y• ceasynge &   of pope Felix to pope Nycolas / consyderynge that   was   man of so  ly   was of   to all t  m    chrysten   / wherefore there was a verse publysshed / as   is sayd.  How syr F ys A  to   Fogyers in Normandye. And of y• losse of Constantynople by the Turke. IN the yere of   Henry. xxvi  beynge tre  Fraumce & Englonde / a knyght of ye englysshe partye named syr Fra¯ceys Aragonois toke a towne in Normandy   Fogyers agaynst the trewse / of whiche takynge began moche sorow & losse / for this was the occasion by y• whiche the frenshmen gate all Normandy.  About this tyme the cite of Constantynople / whiche was the imperyal cite of all grece was taken by the Turkes infydeles / whiche was betrayed as some holde opynyon / & the emperour taken & slayne / and the ryall chirche of saynt Sophia robbed & spoyled / & the  s & ymages & the rode drawen aboute y• stretes / whiche was done in despyte of the chrysten fayth / & soone after all chryste¯ fayth in Grece perisshed & ceased. There were many christen men slayne / & innumerable solde & put in captiuite. By the takynge of this cite the Turke gretly was enhaumced in pryde / & a grete losse to all christendom.  In the .xxviij. yere was a parlyament holden at Westmynster / and from thens adiourned to the blacke freres   London / & after Christmas to Westmynster agayne.  And this same yere Ro erte of Cane a man of the west coumtree   a fewe shyppes toke a grete flete of shippes comyng  out of ye  ay laden wt   whiche shyppes were out of prince /  umders /   /  : & brought them to H mpton / wherfore the march auntes   of Englo¯de beyng in Flaumdres were arested in Bruges / Ipre / & other places & might not be deliuered   theyr dettes disch  uged tyll they had made apoyntment for to paye y•   of those shyppes / whiche was payed by y• marchaumtes of the staple euery peny. And in lyke wyse the marchumtes & goodes beynge in Da  were also arested / and made grete amendes.  This same yere the frensshmen in a mornyng toke by a trayne the towne of Pount de larche / & therin the lorde Fauconbrydge was taken prisoner. And after y• in D er Rom was taken & lost / beynge therin syr Edmond duke of Somerset / the erle of Shrewesbury / whiche by a poyntment left pledges / & lost all Normandy & came home in to Englonde. And duryng y• sayd parliament y• duke of Suffolke was arested / & sent in to y• Coure / & there he was a moneth / & after the kyng did do fetche hym out / for whiche cause all y• comyns were in a grete rumour / what for the delyueraumce of Angeo & Mayn / & after lesynge of all Normandy / & in especyall for y• deth of y• good duke of Glocestre / in so moche in some places men gadred & made them capytayns / as Blewberde & other / whiche were taken & put to deth. And than the sayd parlyament was adiourned to Leycestre. And thy¯der y• kynge brought wt hym y• duke of Suffolk. And when y• comyns vnderstode y• he was out of the Coute & comen thyder / they desyred for to haue execucion on them y• were cause of the delyueraumce of Normandy / & had ben   of the deth of the duke of Glocestre / & had solde Gascoyn & Guyen / of whiche they named to be gylty y• duke of Suffolke as chefe / the lorde Saye / y• bysshop of Salisbury /  yell & many mo . And for to appease the comyns the duke of Suffolk was exiled out of Englonde for .v. yere. And so duryng the parlyament he went in to Norfolke / & there toke shyppyng for to go out of y• realme of Englonde in to Fraumce. And this yere as he sayled on y• see a shyppe of warre called the Nycolas of the toure mette wt his shyppe & foumde hym therin / whome they toke out & brought hym in to theyr shyppe to the mayster & to the capytayn & there he was examyned & at y• last iudged to deth. And so they put hym in a caban & his chapelayn wt him f  to shryue hym. And ye done they brought hy¯ in to Douer rode / & set hy¯ in to y• bote / & there smote of his heed / & brought y• body on londe vpon ye sandes / & set ye heed therby And this was done ye fyrst day of Maye Leo what auayled hym all his  raumte of Normandy &c. And here ye may here how he was rewarded for ye deth of the duke of Glocestre. Thus began sorowe vpon sorowe / & deth for deth.  How this yere was the insurreccyon in Kent of the comyns / of whom Iarke Cade an Irysshe man was capytayne. THe yere of our lorde. M .cccc. & .l. was the grete grace of ye Iubile at Rome / where was grete pardon / in so moche y• from all places in chrystendom grete multytude of people resorted thyder.  And this yere was a grete assemble & gaderynge togyder of the comyns of Kent in grete nombre / & made an insurreccyon / & rebelled agaynst the kyng and his lawes / and ordeyned them a capytayne called Iohan Cade an Irysshe man / whiche named hymselfe Mortymer / cosyn to ye duke of yorke. And this capytayn helde these men togyder / and made ordynaunces amonge them / and brought them to the blacke h th / where he made a byll of p yons to the kyng and his counseyle / & shewed what  tyes and oppressyons the poore comyns   suffred / & all vnder colour for to come to his aboue / & he had a grete multytude of people. And the .xvii. day of Iune the kynge & many lordes / capytayns & men of warte went towarde hym to y• blacke heth. And whan the capytayne of kent vnderstode the comynge of the kynge wt so grete puyssan¯ce / he withdrewe him & his people to Seuenoke a lytell village. And the .xxviij. daye of Iune he beynge withdrawen & gone / the kynge came wt his army set in ordre & embatayled to y• blacke heth. And by aduyse of his counseyle sent syr Vmfrey Stafford knyght and Willyam Stafford squyer two valyaumt capytaynes / with certayn people for to fyght with y• capytayne / & to take hym & brynge hym & his accessaryes to the kyng / whiche went to Seuenoke / & there the capytayn with his felawshyp mette wt them / & fought agaynst them / and in co¯clusyon slewe them bothe / & as many as abode & wolde not yelde them were slayne. Durynge this scarmysshe fell a grete varyaumce amonge the lordes men & comyn people beynge on blacke heth agaynst theyr lordes & capitaynes sayenge playnly y• they wolde go vnto y• capytayn of kent / to assyst & helpe hym but yf they myght haue execucyon on y• traytours beynge about y• kynge / wher to the kynge sayd naye. And they sayd playnly that the lord Saye tresourer of Englonde / & the bysshop of Salysbury / the baron of Dubby / the abbot of Glocestre / Danyell / and Treuilian & many  to were traytours & worthy to be deed Wherfore to please the lordes meyny & also some of y• kynges hous y• lord Saye was arested & sent to y• toure of London. And than y• kynge heryng tydynges of the beth & ouerthrowynge of the Staf  / he withdrewe hym to London / &   to  elyngworth / for y• kyng   lordes burst not trust theyr owne housholde men.  Than after that the capytayne had had this victory vpon y• Staffordes / anone he toke   sallet and his brigandynes full of gylte nayles /   also his   and Arayed hym lyke a lorde and capytayne / and resorted with all his   and also moo than he had before to the blacke hethe agayne. To whome came the archebysshop of Caunterbury / and the duke of Bokyugham to the blacke hethe / and spake with hym. And as it was sayd they foumde hym wytty in his talkyng and in his request. And so they departed. And the thyrde daye of Iuly he came & entred into London with all his people / and there dyd make cryes in the kynges name and in his name / that no man sholde robbe ne take no maner of goodes but yf he payed for it. And came rydynge through the cite in grete pryde and smote his swerde vpon London stone in Canmyk strete. And he beynge in the rite sent to the toure for to haue the lorde Saye / & so they fette hym & brought hy¯ to the Gyldhall before the Mayre & the aldermen / where y• he was examyned. And he sayd he wolde & ought to be iudged by his peres. And y• comyns of Kent toke hym by force fro the Mayre & offycers y• kepte hym / & toke hym to a preest to shryue hym / & or he myght be halfe shryuen they brought hym to the standard in Chep : & there smote of his heed on whose soule god haue mercy. Amen. And thus dyed the lord Saye tresourer of Englo¯de. After this they set his heed vpon a spere / & bare it all about the cite. And y• same day about myle ende   mer was vyheded. And the daye before at after none the capytayne with a certayne of his men went to Philyp Malpas hous / & robbed hym / & toke awaye moche good. And from thens he went to saynt Margarete patyns to one         whiche   of theyr   were   with   her    man   wyse.   London    myn    myghty god   is to   yf he had not robbed   myght   ferre or he   kynge & all the lordes of y• realme of Englonde were  parted / excepte the lorde Seales that   the  oure of London.  And the   of a   South werke. And the   after the May  of London wt the  lderme    comyns of y•   concluded to   the capytayn & his  oost / & sent to the lorde Scales to the Coure / &   a capytayne of Nor   / that they walde y• nyght assayle the captayne   them of kent. And so they dyd / & came to London brydge or the capytayne had any knowlege therof / & there they fought with them that kepte the bryoge. And the   men went to h  came to the bridge & shotte and fought wt them / & gate the bridge / &  de them of London to   / & slewe many of them / & this   all the nyght   & fro   the clocke on y• moro we   last they brent y•  awe brydge   many of   of London were  . In whiche   Sutton an    as slayne / Roger Neys nt &    ogh & many other. And after   the   of Englonde sene to the capytayne a par on generall / for hym & for all his m yuy. And than they departed from South   euery man   his owne hous.   they were all departed & gone / there were proclamacyons made in  ent / Southsex and other places / that what man coude take the capitayn quycke or deed shelde haue a thousande marke. And after this / one Alexander Iden a squyer of kent toke hym in a garden in Southsex. And in y• takynge Iohn Cade the capytayn was slayne / and after byh ded / & his heed set on London brydge. And than anone after the kynge came in to kent / & dyd do syt his Iustyees at Caunterbury / & inquyred who were chefe causers of this ins . And there were.  . men iudged to deth in one daye / & in other places  oo. And fro thens the kynge went in to Southsex & in to the west   / where alytell before was   y• bysshop of Salysbury. And this same yere were so many iudged to deth / that.   hedes stode vpon London bridge at ones.  Of the felde that y• duke of yorke toke at Brentheth in Kent. And of the byrth of prynce Edwarde. And of the  st batayle at saynt Alvons / where   duke of Somerset was slayne. IN the .xxx.  ere of y• kynge y• duke of yorke came out of the marche of Wales with the erle of D shyre and the lorde Cobham and a gr te puyssaunce for reformacyon of certayne  tyes & wronges / & also to haue Iustr e vpon certayne lordes beynge aboute the kynge / and toke a feide at Brentheth besyde Dartforde in Kent / whiche was a stronge felde / for whiche cause the kyng with all the lordes of y•  onde went vnto the blacke heth with a grete & a stronge multytude of people armed & ordeyn  for the warre in y• best wyse. And whan they had mustred on the beth / certayne lordes were tho sent to hym for   & make apoyntment with him /   were the bysshop of Ely / the bysshop of   W  the erles of Salysbury &  . And they concluded that the duke of Somerset shold be had to warde and to answere to suche artycles as the duke of yorke sholde put on hym / & than the duke of yorke sholde breke his felde & come to the kynge / whiche was all promysed by the kynge. And so the kyng co¯ maumded y• the duke of Somerfet sholde be had into warde. And than y• duke of yorke brake vp his felde and came to the kyng. And whan he was come contrary to the promyse afore made / the duke of Somerset was present in y• filde awaytynge and chefe aboute the kynge / and made the duke of yorke tyde before as a prysoner through London / & after they wolde haue put hy¯ in holde. But a noyse arose y• the   of Marche his sone was comynge with .x. M. men toward London / wherfore the kyng & his counseyle feted. And than they concluded that the duke of yorke shold departe at his owne wyll.  Aboute this tyme began grete dyuysyon in Spruce bytwene the grete mayster & the knyghtes of the duche ordre / whiche were lordes of y• coumtree / for the comyns & townes rebelled agaynst the lordes / & made so grete warre that at the last they called y• kynge of Pole to be theyr lorde / the whiche kynge came & was worshypfully receyued / and layde syege to y• castell of Marienburgh / whiche was y• chefe castell of strength of all the lorde / & wanne it / and droue out the mayster of D nske / & all other places of that londe. And so they y• had ben lordes many yeres lost all theyr seygnourye & possessyons in those londes.  And in y• yere of the incarnacyon of our lorde. M.  .  iij. on saynt Edwardes daye / y• quene Marg  was delyuered of a fayre   / whiche was named Edwarde.  That same daye Iohn Norman was   to be Mayre of London. And the daye that     the     whiche   that tyme they    er in  .    vnderstande   to the promyse of the   / & also the conclusyons taken   y• kyng & the duke of yorke at B th / the duke of Somerset went   / but abod  aboute y• kynge / & had grete rule / & anone after he was made capytayn of Calays and ruled the kynge & his  alme as he wolde / wherfore y• grete lordes of th  alme / & also y• comyns were not  . For whiche cause y• duke of   of Warwyk / y•   of Salysbury /   many knyghtes & squyers / and moche other people came to remeue y• said duke of Somerset & other fro y• kynge. And   kyng heryng of theyr comyng / thought by his coumseyle to haue gone westwarde & not for to haue mette wt them / & had wt hym the duke of Somerset / the duke of Bokyngham / y•   of Stafford / y•   of Northumberlonde / y• lord Clyfford / & many other.  And what tyme that the duke of yorke & his   vnderstode that the kyng was departed   these lordes from London / anone he chaumged his waye & costed the coumtre /   came to saynt Albons the. xxii .   of Maye / & there mette wt the kynge / to whome the king sent certayn lordes / & desired   to kepe the peas & departe / but   syon whyle they treated on y• one syde y• erle of Warwyk wt the March  and other entred y• towne on that other syde / & sought agaynst the kynge & his partye / & so began the batayle &   whiche enduted a grete whyle. But in conclusyon the duke of yorke o  and had the victory of that  ourney. In     of Somer   / y• lord   / &   of   estate   / whiche was   in y• by      London in whiche   the   of  orke was made   of   / and the   of W  and the erle of Salysbury Chauncelet of Englonde. And all suche persones as had the rule before aboute y• kyng were sit aparte / and myght not rule as they dyd before.  And this same yere dyed pope Nycolas the fyfth. And after hym was Calixt y• thyrde. This   was a Catalane / and the art   of hym shall be shewed here after.  In this same   fell   London agaynst   bycause a yo  man toke   from   the   was sent for to come before   Mayre & the  ldermen / & there for the offence he was  o¯mytted to warde. And th  the Mayre departed from the   for to go home to his   / but in Chepe the yonge men of y•   for the   prentyses   in Che e     was   / &     from                   wherfore the Mayre and the  ldermen come with the honest people of the Cite and droue them thens / and   some of them that had stolen to Newgate. And whan y• yonge man y• was   by his  elawes sawe this grete rumour / af fraye & robbery enswed of his fryst meuynge to the Lombarde / departed and wente to Westmynster to sent wary / or   had cost hym his lyfe. For anont after came downe an Oyer determined for to do iustyce on all them that so  ebelled in the Cite agaynst the Lombardes / on whiche sate with the May e that tyme Willyam Marow / y• duke of Bo am & many other lordes for to se exe  dont. But the comyns of the   ly made them redy and dyd arme them in theyr houses and were in purpose to haue rongen the comyn bell / whiche is called home bell / but they were   sadde men whiche came to y• knowlege of the duke of Bokyngham & other lordes / and inco¯tynent they arose for    urst no lenger abide / for they   that the hole Cite wolde haue rysen agaynst them. But yet neuerthelesse or thre of y• Cite were iudged to doth for this robbery / & were hanged at    And anone after y• kynge & the quene & other lordes rode to Couentre & withdrewe them from London for this cause And a lytell before y• duke of yorke was sent for to   / & there was discharged of the prot  & the   of Salysbury of his C  & after this they were sent for by y•   scale for to come to   / where they were almoost & y• erle of war  also / and sholde haue ben destroyed yf they had not seen well to.  How the lord   was taken by the   of Sa  / and of the   of  .  THis yere were taken foure grete fysshes bytwene Ereth & London that one was called Mors marine / the seconde was a swerde fysshe / & the other twayne were whales.

Also this yere ye erle of warwyk & his wyfe went to Calays with a fayre felawship & toke possessyon of his offyce.  Aboute this tyme was a grete reformacyon of many monasteryes of relygyon in dyuers partyes of ye worlde / whiche were reformed after the fyrst institucyon / and co¯tynued in many places.  This same yere was a grete batayle in ye marches bytwene the londe of Hungry and Turkey at a place called Septedrad / where innumerable turkes were slayne more by myracle than by mannes hande / for onely ye hande of god smote them. Saint Iohn of Capistrane was there present / & {pro}uoked ye chrysten people beynge than aferde for to pursue after ye Turkes / where an infynyte multytude were slayne & destroyed. And the Turkes sayd yt a grete nombre of armed men folowed them / yt they were aferd to turne agayn / & they were holy aumgels.  This same yere ye prysoners of New gate in London brake theyr pryson / and wente vpon the ledes & fought agaynst them of the cite / & kepte the gate a longe whyle / but at ye last the cite gate ye prison on them / & than they were put in fetters &  ens / & were sore punysshed in ensam   of other.

But he hauyn  knowlege yt he sholde be mette wt   was accompanyed wt his two sones syr Thomas & syr Iohn Neuyll / & a grete   shyp of good men. And so they fought to gyder / where ye erle of Salysbury wa  the felde / & the lorde Awdley was   & many gentylmen of Chessh    & moche people hu te. And ye erles two sones were hurte / & goynge homeward afterward they were taken & had to Ch  by the quenes meyny.  After   Pius was pope / & was chosen this yere M .cccc. & .lviij. and he was called before Eneas an eloquent man and a poete   reate. He was embassadour of the empe rours afore tyme. And he wrote in ye   seyle of Basyle a noble treaty for ye   rite of the same. Also he canonysed   Katheryne of Senys. This pope ordey ned grete indulgence & pardon to them ye wolde go & warre agaynst the Turke   & wrote an epystle to the grete Turke  hortynge hy¯ to become chrysten. And in the ende he ordeyned a passage agaynst the Turke at Ankone to whiche moche people drewe out of all partyes of chrystendome / of whiche people he sent many home agayne / bycause they suffysed not. And anone after he dyed at the sayd place of Ankone the yere of our lord. M .cccc .lxiiij. the .xiiij. daye of August.  How Andrewe Trollop and the sow youres   of Calays forsoke the duke of Yorke and theyr mayster the erle of war wyk in the west countree. THe duke of Yorke / ye erles of warwyk & of Salysbury sawe ye gouernaumce of ye realme stode moost by the quene & her coumseyle / & how ye grete prynces of ye londe were not called to coumseyle but set aparte / & not onely so / but it was sayd through the realme that those said lordes sholde be destroyed vtterly / as it openly was shewed at Bloreheth by them that wolde haue slayne ye erle of Salysbury. Than they for saluacyon of theyr lyues / & also for ye comyn wele of the realme thought to remedy these thynges assembled them togider wt moche people & toke a felde in ye west coumtre / to whiche the erle of Warwyk came fro Calays wt many of ye olde sowdyours / as Andrewe Trollop & other / in whose wysdome as for ye warre he moche trusted. And wham they were thus assembled & made theyr felde / the kyng sent out his commyssyons & preuy seales vnto all ye lordes of his realme / to come & wayte on hym in theyr moost best defensable aray. And so euery man came in suche wise yt the kyng was stronger & had more people than ye duke of yorke & ye erles of warwyk & of Salysbury. For it is here to be noted that euery lorde in Englonde durst not disobey ye quene / for she ruled peasybly all yt was done about ye kyng / whiche was a good & a well disposed man. And than whan ye kyng was comen to the place where as they were / the duke of yorke & his felaw shyp made theyr felde in ye strongest wyse & purposed verily to haue byde¯ & fought but in ye nyght Andrewe Trollop & all ye olde sowdyours of Calays wt a grete felawshyp sodeynly departed out of ye dukes hoost / & wente streyght to ye kynges feld / where they were ioyously receyued for they knewe ye entent of ye other lordes & also ye maner of theyr felde. And than ye duke of yorke wt the other lordes seynge them deceyued / toke a coumseyle shortly in the same nyght / & departed from ye felde leuynge behynde them the moost party of theyr people to kepe ye felde tyll on the morowe. Than the duke of Yorke wt his second sone departed through wales toward Irlonde / leuynge his eldest sone yt erle of Marche wt the erles of warwik & of Salysbury / whiche rode togyder wt thre or foure persones streyght in to Deuenshyre / & there by helpe & ayde of one Denham a squyer gate for the¯ a shyppe which cost .xj. score nobles / & wt the same shyppe sayled from thens in to Garnesey / & there refresshed them / & fro thens sayled to Calais / where they were receyued in to ye castell by yt posterne or they of ye towne wyst of it. And the duke of Yorke toke shyppynge in Wales & sayled ouer in to Irlonde / where he was well receyued.  How ye erles of Marche / Warwyk / & Salysbury entred in to Calays / & how the erle of warwyk went in to Irlonde. THan kynge Henry beynge wt his hoost in ye felde not knowynge of this sodeyn departynge / on the morowe foumde none in ye felde of ye said lordes / sent out in all ye haste men for to folowe & pursue after to take them / but they met not with them as god wolde. And than the kyng went to Ludlowe / & despoyled the castell & the towne / & sent the duchesse of yorke & her children to ye duchesse of Bokyngham her syster / where as she was kepte longe tyme after. And forth wt the kyng ordeyned the duke of Somerset to be capytayn of Calays. And these other lordes so departed as afore is sayd were proclaymed rebelles & grete traytours. Than ye duke of Somerset toke to hym all ye sowdyours yt departed from ye felde   and made hym redy in all the haste to go to Calays & take possessyon of his offyce And whan he came there he foumde ye erle of warwik therin as capitayn / & ye erles of Marche & of Salysbury also / & than he londed by Scales & went to Guynes and there he was receyued. And it fortuned that some of tho shyppes that came ouer with hy¯ came in to Calays hauen by theyr free wyll / for ye shypmen ought more fauour to ye erle of warwik than to the duke of Somerset / in whiche shyppes were taken dyuers men / as Ienyn Finkhyl / Iohn felow / Kaylles & Purser whiche were byheded soone after in Calays.  And after this came men dayly ouer the see to these lordes to Calays / & began to wexe stronger & stronger / and they borowed moche good of the staple. And on yt other syde ye duke of Somerset beynge in Guynes gate people to hym / whiche came out & scarmysshed wt them of Calays / & they of Calays with them whiche endured many dayes. Duryng this scarmysshynge moche people came ouer dayly vnto these lordes. Than on a tyme by ye aduyse & counseyle of ye lordes of Calays sente ouer mayster Denham with a grete felawshyp to Sandwyche whiche toke the towne / & therin ye lorde Ryuers & ye  lord  Scales his sone / & toke many shyppes in the hauen / & brought them all to Calays / wt whiche shyppes many maryners of theyr free wyl came to Calays to serue the erle of Warwyk. And after this the erle of warwyk by ye aduyse of the lordes toke al his shyppes & manned them well & sayled hy¯selfe in to Irlonde for to speke wt the duke of Yorke & to take his aduise how they shold entre in to Englonde. And whan he had ben there & done his crandes / he returned agayn toward Calays / & brought wt hym his moder ye coumtesse of Salisbury. And comynge in ye west countre vpon the see the duke of Excestre admyral of englo¯de beynge in ye grace of dieu accompanyed wt many shippes of warre mette wt the erle of warwyk & his flete / but they fought not / for ye substaumce of ye people beynge wt the duke of Excestre ought better wyll & fauour to ye erle of warwik than to hym & they departed & came safe to Calays.  Than ye ky¯ges coumseyle seynge yt these lordes had gote¯ those shyppes fro Sand wyche & taken ye  lord  Ryuers & his sone ordeyned a garnyson at Sandwyche to kepe ye towne / & made one Moumford cap  tayn of ye towne / & yt no ma¯ ne v  marchaumt yt  shold  go to Flaumdres   go to Calais. Than they of Calais   this / made out mayster Denham & many other to go to Sandwyche & so the  dyd / & assayled the towne by water & by londe / & gate it / & brought the capytayn ouer see & smote of his heed / & yet dayly men came ouer to them fro all partyes.  How ye erles of Marche of warwyk and of Salisbury entred in to Englonde And of the felde of Northamton / where dyuers lordes were slayne. ANd after this ye foresayd erles of Marche / warwyk & Salisbury came ouer to Douer with moche people & there lo¯ded / to whom al ye coumtre drewe & came to London all armed & for to let ye lordes of ye ky¯ges coumseyle knowe theyr treuth & also theyr entent assembled the¯ & tolde them yt they ente¯ded no harme  o the kynges {per}sone saue yt they wolde put from hym suche {per}sones as were aboute hym. And so departed from London with a grete puyssaumce toward Northamton where the kyng was accompanyed with many lordes / & had made a stronge felde without ye towne. And there bothe partyes me  & was fought a grete batayle. In whiche batayle were slayne ye duke   of Bokyngham / y• erle of Shrewesbury the vycoumt Beamond / y• lord Egremond & many knightes & squyers & other also & the kynge hymselfe was taken in the felde / & afterwarde brought to London. And anone after was a parlyament at Westmynster / durynge whiche parlyament the duke of Yorke came out of Irlonde with the erle of Rutlonde / rydyng with a grete felawshyp in to the palays at westmynster & toke y• kynges palays And came in to y• parlyament chambre & there toke y• kynges place / & claimed the crowne as his {pro}pre enherytaumce & right & cast forth in wrytyng his tytell / & also how he was ryghtfull heyre / wherfore was moche to do / but in conclusion it was appoynted & concluded that kyng Henry sholde regne & be kyng duryng his naturall lyfe / for as moche as he had be¯ kyng so longe & was possessed / & after his deth the duke of Yorke sholde be kynge / & his heyres kynges after hym / & forth with sholde be proclaymed heyre apparaumt / & sholde also be {pro}tectour & regent of Englonde duryng the kynges lyfe / wt many other thynges ordeyned in y• same parlyament / & yf kynge Henry durynge his lyfe went from his appoyntment or ony artycle concluded in y• sayd parliament / he shold be deposed / & the duke shold take y• crowne & be kynge. All whiche thynges were enacted by y• auctorite of the same / at whiche parlyament y• comyn hous comonyuge & treatyng vpon y• tytel of y• sayd duke of Yorke / sodeynly fell downe the crowne whiche henge than in y• myd des of y• sayd hous / whiche is y• frayter of the abbaye of Westmynster / whiche was taken for a prodyge or token that y• regne of kynge Henry was ended. And also y• crowne whiche stode on y• hyghest toure of the steple in the castell of Douer fell downe this same yere.  Now y• duke of Yorke was slayn / & of y• felde of Wakefelde / & of y• second iourney at saynt Albons by y• quene & the prince. THan for as moche as y• quene wt y• prynce her sone was in y• north & absent her fro y• kyng / & obeyed not suche thynges as were concluded in y• parlyament / it was ordeyned y• the duke of Yorke as protectout shold go northward to brynge in y• quene / & subdue suche as wolde not obey / wt whom went y• erle of Salysbury / syr Thomas Neuyl his sone / wt moche people. And at wakefeld in Chrystmasse weke they were all ouerthrowen & slayne by lordes of the quenes party / yt is to wyte / y• duke of Yorke was slayne / the erle of Rutlond / syr Thomas Neuyll & many moo / & y• erle of Salisbury was taken & other / as Iohn Harowe of London capitayn & ruler of y• fotemen & Hanson of Hull / Whiche were brought to Poumfret / & there after biheded & theyr hedes sent to Yorke & set vpon the gates And thus was y• noble prynce y• duke of Yorke slayne / on whose soule god haue mercy. And this tyme y• erle of Marche beynge in shrowesbury heryng of y• deth of his fader / desyred ayde of the towne to aue¯ge his faders deth / & fro thens went to wales / & at Ca¯delmas after he had a batayle at Mortymers crosse agaynst y• erle of Penbroke & of wylshyre / where y• erle of Marche had y• victory. Than the quene wt those lordes of the north after yt they had dystressed & slayne the duke of Yorke & his felawshyp came southward wt a grete multytude of people for to come to y• kynge & vndo suche conclusyons as had ben taken before by y• parliament. Agaynst whose comynge y• duke of Nor folke / the erle of warwyk wt moche people & ordynaumce went to saynt Albons / & lad kyng Henry wt them / & there encoumtred togider in suche wyse & fought / so y•   the duke of Norfolke & y• erle of warwik with many other of theyr party  ledde & lost y• iourney / where y• king Henry was taken by y• quene & prynce Edwarde his sone / whiche two had goten that felde. Than y• quene & her party beynge at her aboue sent anone to London / which was on asshewednesdaye y• fyrst daye of lent for vytayle / for whiche y• Mayre ordeyned by y• aduyse of y• aldermen y• certayn cartes laden wt vytayle sholde be sent to saynt Albons to them. And whan y• cartes came to crepylgate / the comyns of y• cite y• kepte the gate toke y• bytayle fro y• cartes & wold not suffre it to passe. Than were there certayn aldermen & comyns appoynted to go to Bernet to speke with the quenes coumseyle / for to entreate y• the northeren men sholde be sent home in to theyr coumtre agayn / for y• cite of London drad fore to be despoyled yf they had comen.  And duryng this treaty tydynges came that the erle of Warwyk had mette with y• erle of Marche on Cotteswolde comynge out of Wales wt a grete meyny of walsshmen / & that they bothe were comynge to London ware. Anone as these tydynges were knowen y• treaty was broke / tor y• kyng / quene / prynce & all y• other lordes y• were wt them departed fro saynt Albons no thwarde wt all theyr people / yet or they departed thens they dyheded y• lord Bo yle & syr Thomas   whiche   take in y• iourney done on  .  Than y• duch  of Yorke beynge at London deryng of y• losse of y• felde of saynt Albons     whiche went to  ght.  And philip malpas  che marchaumt of London / Thomas Vaghan squyer /   many other   of y• comynge of y• quene to London / toke a shyppe of Andwerpe to haue gone in to  land /   on y• other co st were taken of one Colompne a Frenssheman a shyppe of warre / & he toke them prysoners / and brought them in to Fraumce / where they payed grete good for theyr raunsom / & there was moche good and rychesse in that shyppe.  Of the deposynge of kyng Henry the syxth / & how kynge Edward the fourth toke possessyon / & of y• batayle on Palme sondaye / and how he was crowned. THan whan y• erle of Marche & y• erle of warwyk had mette togyder on Cotteswolde / inco¯tynent they concluded to go to London / and sent worde anone to y• Mayre & to the cite that they wolde come. And anone y• cite was glad of theyr comynge / hopyng to be releued by them / & so they came to London. And whan they were comen & had spoken wt the lordes & estates beynge there / concluded for as moche as kynge Henry was gone wt them northwarde / y• he had forfeyted his crowne & ought to be deposed accordyng vnto the actes made & passed in the last parlyament. And so by the aduyse of the lordes spirytuall & temporall than beynge at London / the erle of Marche Edward by y• grace of god eldest sone of Rycharde duke of Yorke / as ryghtfull heyre and nexte enherytour to his fader the fourth daye of Marche / the yere of out lord god.

To whome all y• lordes spirytuall & te¯porall dyd homage as to theyr souerayn lord & kyng. And forthwith it was {pro}claymed through y• cite kyng Edward the fourth of y• name. And anone after y• kynge rode in his ryall estate northwarde wt all his lordes to subdue his subgectes y• tyme beynge in the north / & for to auenge his     deth. And on Palmesondaye after he had a grete batayle in y• north coumtree at a place called Cowton / not ferre from Yorke / where with y• helpe of god he gate y• felde & had the victory / where were slayne of his aduersaryes .xxx. M. men and moo / as it was sayd by them that were there. In the whiche batayle were slayne y• erle of Northumberlonde the lorde Clifford / syr Iohn Neuyll the erle of Westmerlondes broder / Andrewe Trollop / and many knightes & squyers  Than kyng Henry that had be¯ kyng beynge with y• quene and the prynce at Yorke heryng the losse of that felde / and so moche people slayne & ouerthrowen / anone forth with departed all thre with the duke of Somerset / the lorde Roos & other towarde Scotlo¯de. And the nexte daye after kynge Edward with all his army entred in to Yorke / and was there proclaymed kyng & obeyed as he ought to be. And y• Mayre / aldermen & comyns swore to be his iyege men. And wham he had taryed a whyle in the north / & that all y• northcoumtree had turned to hym he returned southwarde / leuynge behynde hym the erle of Warwyk in those partyes to gouerne and rule that countree.  And aboute mydsomer after the yere of our lorde. M .cccc .lx. and the fyrst yere of his regne he was crowned at Westmynster / & anoynted kyng of Englonde hauynge possessyon of all the realme. CAixtus the thyrde was pope after Nycolas thre yere and .v. monethes. This Calixte was an olde man whan he was chosen pope / & was co¯tynually seke / ne he myght not fulfyll his desyre whiche he ente¯ded to do agaynst the Turkes / for dethe came vpon hym. He was chosen pope in y• yere of our lord  .   .lv. And he dyed the syxth day af   he had i stytued the tra¯sfiguracyon of our lorde god. He also c nonysed saynt Vincent a frere precher. And there was a grete reformacyon of many monasteryes in dyuers partyes of the worlde / & these reformacions were made many ty mes / but almoost none abode / but they returned agayne as they were afore by successyon of tyme after y• deth of y• worshypfull faders. The feest of the Transfyguracyon was ordeyned of Calixt for the gyft of grace of y• meruaylous victory done agaynst the Turke in Hungary on saynt Sixtus daye. M .cccc. l ij. For there was a meruaylous victo  gyuen to christen men in Hungary agaynst the grete Turke / & there he lost many a ma¯ & fledde shamefully for drede of his enemyes / & no man folowed by / but alone y• hand of god fered the Turke & his hoost on saynt Calixtes day. Saynt Iohn de Capistrano was there seen present / & he prouoked the people that were aferde to folowe the myshyleuynge Turkes / and there fell a grete   on them / for the Turkes sayd y• there was so grete a nombre of knyghtes that folowed them that  th they durst loke backwarde and therfore they fledde & leste all theyr tresour behynde them / & they were holy aungelles that caused them to flee.  Nota.  Prynters of bokes were this tyme myghtely multiplyed in Ma g cie & through out y• worlde / & there began fyrst, & helde theyr   / & this tyme many m n began to be more subtyll incraftes &  er th  euer they were afore.  y• second was pope after    lixt .vi. yere. This  {us} was chosen in the yere of our lorde    .cccc.    & he was called E  as an    & a grete oratour / a laurente porte & afore he was y• emperours embassadour / & in y• co¯cyle of Basyle he wrote a noble treatyse for y• auctorite of y• same. This man   desyred to haue a passage to the Turke And moche people of dyuers countrees came to Rome / & he gaue them his blessynge & sent them home agayn / for they were not sufficyent for y• Turkes hoost / and   after he decessed. PAulus a venicyan was pope after Pius .vij. yere This Paulus was chosen in the yere of our  lord  Iesu Chryst. M .cccc. and .lxiiij. And anone he alowed the feest of the Presentacyon of our lady as Pius dyd. This man was a taught man in ryght wysnes / and he sayd it was better to make fewe thynges & kepe them stedfastly / than for to make many & soone reuoke them. And he made a grete palays at saynt Markes / & he decessed or that he had ended it in the yere of our lorde Iesu Chryst. M .cccc. & .lxxi.  Leodin¯. the londe of Luke was oppressed with many tribulacyons and after in the yere of our lorde Iesu Chryst. M .cccc. & .lxviij. vtterly it was destroyed by Charles the duke of Burgoyne / the whiche wedded dame Margarete syster to kyng Edward y• fourth of Englonde. Also the same duke Charles entred in to the londe of Geldre / & con quered it all.  The yere of grace was also chaumged by pope Paule for fauour of mannes soule from .xxv. yere vnto .xxv. yere. And bycause y• cursednes habounded so sore / grace habounded as sore. SIxtus the fourth a Geneuoys & a  rere mynour was pope after Paule. This man was generall in the ordre of y• fre e mynours or he was cardynall. And he was chosen in the yere of our lorde god. M .cccc .lxxj. and was called Fra¯ciscus de Sanona / of good fame and vertuous. He was chosen cardynall without his knowlege tyll he was made. And the same yere that he was chosen pope / the Turke had taken from chrysten men two empyres and .iiij. kyngdomes .xx. prouynces / and two hondred  tees / and had destroyed men & women without nombre. And that meued the pope that he sholde dyspose hym to go to withstande hym. And for an army to be made against the Turke / the pope gaue grete indulgences of pardon of the treasour of the chirche vnto all chrysten realmes / that he myght ordeyn some trea sour to withstande that mysbyleuynge Turke. And in the realme of Englonde Iohn abbot of Abyngdon was the popes legate to dispose this godly treasour of the chirche vnto euery faythfull man that was disposed / and that wolde ab  themselfe to receyue it.  Thus endeth the Cronycles of Englonde with the fruyte of tymes / compyled in a boke. And was fyrst imprynted by one somtyme scole mayster of saynt Albons / on whose soule god haue mercy Amen. And now lately imprynted at London / and dilygently amended in dyuers places where as ony faute was / in Flete strete / at the sygne of the Sonne / by me Wynkyn de Worde / in the yere of our lorde god. M .CCCCC .xxviij. the ix. daye of Apryll.  The names of this ylonde. Caplo .j. FIrste (as Galfridus sayth) this lo¯de was called Albyon after y• name of Albyne y• elpest doughter of Dio clesyan / & had .xxxij. systers / & they were the fyrst that enhabyted this londe / and bycause she was the eldest syster / she named this londe Albyon after her owne name as the cronycles reherseth. Other saye that this londe was named Albion as it were y• whyte lo¯de of whyte rockes about the clyues of y• see y• were seen fro ferre. Afterward Brute conquered this londe & called it Brytayn after his owne name. And than saxons or Englysshmen conquered this londe & called it Anglia y• is Englonde. Or it is called Anglia of a quene y• owed this lo¯d y• was named Angela / & was a noble dukes doughter of   the Saxons. Or as  ysid  sayth Ethi .xv.

Alfre. The Britysshe Anglia is called the other worlde and for grete plente of all good the grete Charles called it his owne chambre.  Solinus. The edge of y• frensshe clyf sholde be the ende of the worlde / yf the ylonde of Brytayn ne were not / whiche is worthy to haue the name of an other worlde.  Alfre. This ylonde is called insula for it is in salo / that is the see / & is beten of with dyuers course of waters with stremes & with wawes of the see.

This ylonde is plenteous of vaynes of metalles / of bras / of yren / of leed / of tynne / & of syluer also.  Plim{us} li .vj. ca .vj. In this ylonde vnder the turfe of the lo¯de is foumde good merle / the thryfty of the farnes dryeth hy¯self therin. So y• euer the thycker y• felde is merled y• better corne it wyll bere. There is also an other maner whyte merle y• the londe is the better .lxxx. yere y• therwith is merled.  Solin{us}. In this ylonde groweth a stone that is called gagates / yf ye wyll knowe his fayrnes / it is blacke as gemmes ben / yf ye wyll knowe his kynde / it brenneth in water / & quencheth in oyle / and as to his myght / yf the stone be froted & chafed it holdeth what hy¯ nigheth as Succuns a stone that is so named.   Ynd.  li .xv. There ben shepe that bere good woll. There ben many hartes and wylde beestes & fewe wolues / therfore shepe ben the surer wtout kepyng lefte in the felde.   . In this ylonde also ben many citees & townes fayre & noble and ryche / many grete ryuers & stremes wt grete ple¯te of fysshe / many fayre wodes & grete / with ryght many beestes came and wylde. The erth of that londe is copyous of metall oor / & of salte welles / of quarreys of marble of diuers maner stones / of reed / of whyte / of softe & of harde of chalke & of whyte lyme. There is also whyte claye & reed for to make pottes / crockes / stenes & other vessell / and brent tyle to couer the houses & chirches / as it were in the other samia / that is named samos also. Flaumdres loueth well y• woll of this londe / & Hollonde the skylles and felles of al maner beestes. Guyen y• yren & the leed. Irlonde the oor & the salt. All Europa loueth & desyreth y• whyte metall of this londe.  Alfre. Britayn hath ynough of al mater y• there nedeth to bie & sell / or is nedefull to mannes vse / there lacketh neyther salte nor yren. Therfore a versefyour in his metre prayseth this londe in this maner. Englond is a good londe fruytful of woll / but it is a corner. Englonde is full of playe / free men well worthy to playe / free men / free tongues free hertes / & free ben all theyr thynges / theyr handes is more free & better than theyr tongue. Also Englo¯de is beauteous of londe / floure of londes all aboute / that lo¯de is full payed wt fruyte & good of his owne / that londe releueth straunge men that hath nede therto. And wham hunger greueth other londes / that londe fedeth them. That londe bereth fruyte & corne grete plente ynough. That londe is well at ease as lo¯ge as men lyue in peas / eest & west in eche londe ben wel knowen the hauens of Englo¯de. Theyr shyppes foumdes   & ofte helpeth many londes.

Londe hony mylke chese this ylonde therof shall bere the pryce. This ylonde hath no nede of other londes / al lo¯des must seke helpe at this alone. Of the lyking of theyr woun might wonder kyng Salomon. The ryches y• there is an / wold desire Octauia¯.  Of the meruayles & wonders. ca .iiij. IN Brytayn ben hote welles well arayed & adressed to y• vse of manhode / maystresse of those welles is the grete spiryte Minerua. In her hous the fyre endureth alway that neuer chaungeth in to asshes / but there y• fyre slaketh it chaumgeth in to stone clottes.  Alfre. In Brytayn ben many wonders / neuer theles foure ben moost wonderfull / the first is at Pecton / there bloweth so stronge wynde out of the chynes of the erthe that it casteth vp agayne clothes y• men cast in. The second is at Stonehenge besyde Salysbury / there ben grete stones & wonders huge / & be¯ rered on hygh as it were gates set vpon other gates. Neuertheles it is not knowen clerely ne apperceyued how & wherfore they ben so arered and so wonderfully hanged. The thyrde is at Cherdhoke / there is a grete holownes vnder y• erth / often many men haue walked therin / & haue seen ryuers & stremes / but no where can they fynde none ende. The fourth is / that rayne is seen reysed vpon hylles / & none spronge about in the feldes. Also there is a grete ponde that conteyneth .lx. ylondes couenable for men to dwell in / that ponde is becleped about wt syxe score roches / and vpon euery roche an egles nest / and thre score ryuers renne in to y• ponde / & none of them all ren in to y• see but one. There is a ponde closed aboute wt wall of tyle & of stone. In that ponde men wasshe and bathe ryght sore / & euery man feleth the water hote or colde ryght as he wyll hy¯ selfe. There ben salte welles ferre from the see / & ben salte all y• weke longe vnto saterdaye at none / & fresshe fro saterday at none vnto mondaye. The water of these welles whan it is soden turneth in to small salte fayre & whyte. Also there is a ponde / the water therof hath wonders werkynge / for though all an hoost stode by the ponde & turned theyr faces thyderwarde / the water wolde drawe them violently towarde y• ponde & wete all theyr clothes / and so sholde a hors be drawen in the same wyse. And yt y• face be turned awaye fro the water / the water noyeth not. There is a well that no streme renneth fro neyther therto / & yet foure maner of fysshe ben taken therin / that well is but .xx. fote longe  .  . fote brode / & not depe but to the knee / & closed with hye bankes on euery syde. In the coumtree about Wynchestre is a denne or a caue / out of that caue bloweth alwaye a stronge wynde / so that no man may endure to stande to fore y• denne or cane.  There is also a ponde y• turneth tree in to yren yf it be therin a yere / & so trees ben shapen in to whetstones. Also there is in the toppe of an hyll buryels / euery man that cometh & meteth that buryell he shall fynde it euen of his owne length & mesure. And yf a pylgrym knele therto / anone he shall be all fresshe & fele no grefe of werynes.  Gir. in top. Fast by the mynstre of wymburney (that is not ferre fro Bathe) is a wode that bereth moche fruyte / yf the trees of that wode fall in to water or groumde that is nygh & lye there all a yere / the trees turne in to stones.  Gir. in itinere. Vnder y• cite of Chestre renneth the ryuer Dee / that   now departeth Englo¯de & wales. That riuer chaumgeth eueri moneth his sordes as men of that coumtre tell / & leueth often the chanel / but whether y• water drawe more towarde Englonde or toward Wales / to what syde y• it be / that yere men of that syde haue y• worst ende & be ouer set. And men of that other syde shal haue better ende & ben at theyr aboue. Whan the water so chaungeth his course it bo deth suche happes. This riuer Dee ren neth & cometh out of a lake that hyght Pymblemere. In this ryuer is grete plente of samon / neuertheles in the lake is neuer samon founde.  Wilhel. dere. le .ij. Take hede how grete lyght and bryghtnes hath ben shewed vpon Englysshmen syth they fyrst turned to ryght byleue. So y• of no men in ony prouynce ben foumden so many hole bodyes of men after theyr dethe / in lykenes of euerlastynges that shall be after the daye of dome / as it well semeth in these holy sayntes Etheldrede / Edmond the kyng / Elphege / Edgar / Cuthberte / and saynt Edward / & many other / I trowe that it be done by a specyall grace of almyghty god / for the nacion that is set as it were without the worlde sholde take hede to buryenge of bodyes wtout corrupcyon & rottynge / and ben the more bolde and stedfast for to trust vpon the fynall arysyng of deed bodyes for to last euermore after the daye of dome.  Of the chefe partyes of the same londe. Ca .v. AFter the fyrst Brutes tyme the ylonde of Brytayne began for to haue the pryncypall partyes / that ben Loegria / Cambria that is Wales / & Albania that is now Scotlonde. Loegria hath that name of Locrinus that was  es eldest sone / & hyght Loegria as it were Locrinus londe. But now Loegria is called Englonde. The boundes & markes were therof somtyme y• frensshe see bothe by cest & by south.  Beda li .j. ca .ij. And by north two armes of the see that breketh ferre in to the londe eyther agaynst other / but they reche not togyder. The eest arme of those twayne begynnynge aboute a two lytell myle fro y• mynstre of Ebburcurynge. In the west syde of Penulton in y• arme is a towne y• is called Guydy / the west arme of these twayne hath in the ryght syde a stronge cite that hight Alcliud / whiche in theyr language is called Clyntstone / and standeth vpon a ryuer y• is called Clynt also.  R. Some men wolde mene that Loegria endeth at Humbre / & stretcheth no ferther northwarde. The seconde party of Brytayn is called Albania y• is Scotlonde / & hath that name of Albanactus Brutes sone / & stretcheth fro y• foresayd two armes of y• see northward vnto y• see of Norway. Neuertheles the south partyes of Albania where as Pictes dwelled somtyme / that lyeth from y• water of Twede vnto the scottysshe see. All y• longed somtyme to y• kingdom of Northumberlonde Brenycorne the north syde of Northumberlonde fro the fyrst tyme of Englysshe kynges to y• tyme wham Kyna dius kyng of Scotlond y• was Alpinus sone dyd away y• Pictes / & so ioyned that coumtre to y• kyngdom of Scotlonde. The thyrde party of Britayn is Wales Wallia that hyght Cambria also / & hath y• name Cambria of Cambre Brutes sone for he was pry¯ce of wales. In y• eest syde Seuarne somtyme departed bytwene Englonde & Wales. But in y• north syde the ryuer of Dee at Chestre / and in the south the ryuer y• is named Vaga at the castell of Strygelyn departeth Englo¯de & wales. Also kynge Offa for to haue a dystynccyon for euermore bytwene the   kynges of Englonde & of wales / made a longe dyche y• stretcheth forth out of the south syde by Bristowe vnder the hylles of wales Seuarne & Dee almoost to the hedes & vnto y• mouth of y• ryuer of Dee beyonde Chestre fast by the castell it renneth bytwene Colehyll & the mynstre of Basyngwerke in to y• see. This dyche is yet in many places seen. In saynt Edwardes tyme walshmen shold not passe that dyche wt wepen vpon a grete payne And that was at y• erle Haroldes procurynge / as it shall be sayd here after. But now in eyther sydes bothe of that halfe and of this halfe y• dyche / & specyally in the shyres of Chestre / of Shrowesbury and of Herford in many places ben Englysshmen & walshmen medled togyder.  Of the ylondes that ben therto adiacent. Ca .vj. BRytayne hath thre ylondes that ben nygh and longynge therto al without y• ylondes Orcades / as it were answerynge to the thre chefe partyes of Brytayn. For the yle of wyght lo¯geth & lyeth to Loegria that is Englonde. The ylonde Mon that is called Angleseia also longeth to Wales. And y• ylonde Eubonia that hath two other names / & is called Meneuia & Man also / whiche longeth to Scotlo¯de. And all these thre ylondes / Wyght / Mon / & Man ben almoost alyke moche & of quantite / of the whiche thre alarowe foloweth our speche.  Be da li .j. ca .iij. Claudius sent Vaspasian{us} and Vaspasianus wanne Wyght / and Wyght stretcheth out of the eest in to y• west .xxx. myle longe / & out of the south in to the north .xij. myle / and is in y• eest syde .vj. myle fro the south clyf of Brytayne / & thre myle in y• west syde.  Beda li .iiij. ca .v. The mesure of this ylond as Englysshmen gesse / is a thousande housholdes & two hondred.  Git. in itinere. Mon that is called Angleseia also is departed from northwales by a short arme of the see as it were two myle brode. In Mon ben .CCC. townes & .xliij. and ben acco¯pted for candredes that ben two hondredes. The ylond is as it were xxx. myle longe / & .xij. myle brode. Candredus is so moche londe as conteyneth an hondred townes / that name Candredus is made out of two languages / of Brytysshe & of Irysshe. In praysyng of this ylo¯de walshmen were wont to saye a prouerbe and an olde same. Mon Man kembry / that is to say in englysshe / that londe is so good / that it semeth y• it wold fynde corne ynough for all y• men of Wales. Therfore Virgils verses may be accordynge therto / as moche as gnawes / beestes longe Inneth dawes / so moche efte bryngeth colde dewe in a nyght. In that arme of the see that departeth this londe & northwales / is a swalowe that draweth shyppes to it that sayleth by / & swaloweth them in ryght as doth Cylla & Caribdis y• ben two peryllous places in the see of myddle erthe. Therfore men may not sayle by this swalowe but slyly at a ful see.  R. Of the meruayles and wonders of the ylonde of Mon thou shalte fynde in the chapytre of Wales.  Gir. in itinere. The thyrde ylonde y• is called bothe Eubonia & Mene a that is Man standeth in the myddle bytwene y• Irysshe vlstere & y• scottysshe galleway as it were the nauell of the see.  Beda li .ij. ca .ix. This ylonde Man co¯reyneth as it were two ylondes. The fyrste is southward the more coumtre / & the better corne londe / & co¯teyneth .ix .C. & .lx. housholdes. The seconde conteyneth y• space of .CCC. and moo as Englysshmen gesse.  Giral. in top. Somtyme was stryfe whether this ylonde Man shold long to Britayn or to Irlond / & for as moche as   venymous wormes that were brought thyder lyued there / it was iudged that the ylonde of Man sholde longe to Brytayn.  R. In that ylonde is sortylege & wytchecraft vsed. For women there sell to shypmen wynde / as it were closed vnder thre knottes of threde / so that ye more wynde he wyll haue / ye moo knottes he must vndo. There often by daye tyme men of that londe se men that ben deed tofore hande byheded or hole / and what dethe they dyed. Alyens set theyr feet vpon the feet of men of that londe for to se suche syghtes as ye men of that londe done.  Beda li .ij. Scottes dwelled first in this ylonde.  Thanatos that is Tenet / and is an ylonde besydes Kent / and hath that name Thanatos of deth of serpentes / for there be none / and the erthe therof sleeth serpe¯tes borne in other londes. There is noble corne londe & ryght fruytfull. It is supposed that this ylonde was halowed & blyssed of saynt Austyn the fyrst doctour of Englysshmen / for there he arryued fyrst.  Of the kynges hye wayes and stretes. Ca .vij. MOliuncius was the .xiij. kynge of Brytons / and was the fyrst that gaue them lawe. He ordeyned that plowmen folowes / goddes temples and hygh wayes that lede men to cytees & townes sholde haue y• fredome of colour so that euery man that wente to ony of them for socour or for trespace yt he had done / sholde be safe for pursute of all his enemyes. But afterward for the wayes were vntertayne / and stryfe was had / therfore Belinus the kynge that was ye foresayd Moliuncius sone / for to put awaye all stryfe and doubte / made foure hygh kynges wayes / preuyleged with   preuylege & fredom. And the wayes   through the ylonde. The fyrst and gretest of the foure wayes is called Fosse / and stretcheth out of the south in to the north / and begynneth from ye corner of Cornewayle and passeth forth by Deuenshyre by Somerset / and forth besydes Tetbury vpon Cotteswold besyde Couentre vnto Leycestre / and so forth by wylde playnes towarde Newarke / and endeth at Lyncolne. The seconde chefe kynges hye waye is named watlyngstrete / and stretcheth thwarte ouer Fosse / out of the southeest in to the north west / & begynneth at Douer / & passeth by the myddle of Kent ouer Temse besyde London by Westmynster / and so forth by saynt Albons in the west syde by Donstable by S ratford by Towcetre / by Wedom / by south Lylleborne / by Atheryston vnto Gylbertes hyll / yt now is called wrekene / & forth by Seuarne / and passeth besydes Wrokcestre / & than forth to Stratton / and so forth by the myddle of Wales vnto Cardykan / and endeth at the Irysshe see. The thyrde waye is called Erynnugestrete / & stretcheth out of the westnorth west in to the eestsoutheest / & begynneth in Meneuia that is saynt Dauids londe in west Wales / & stretcheth forth vnto Southamton. The fourth is called Rikenyldstrete & stretcheth forth by Worcestre / by Wycombe / and by Birmyngeham by Lechfelde / by Derby / by Chestrefelde / by Yorke / and forth vnto Tynmouth.  Of the famous ryuers and stremes. Ca .viij. THere be¯ thre famous ryuers renny¯ge through Britayn / by ye whiche thre ryuers marchaumtes of beyonde the see comen in shyppes in to Brytayn well nygh out of all maner of nacyons & londes. These thre ryuers ben Temse / Seuarne / & Humbre. The see ebbeth &   floweth at these thre ryuers / and departeth the thre prouinces of y• ylonde / as it were the thre kyngdomes asondre. The thre partyes ben Loegria / Cambria / & Northumbria / that is myddle Englo¯de wales & Northumberlonde.  R. This name Tamyse semeth made one name of two names of two ryuers / that ben Tame & yse / for the ryuer of Tame renneth besydes Dorchestre & falleth in yse / therfore all y• ryuer fro y• fyrst heed vnto the eest see is named Tamyse or Temse. Temse begy¯neth besyde Tetbury / that is .iij. myle by north Malmesbury / there the Temse spryngeth of a well that renneth eestwarde & passeth the Fosse / & departeth Glocestre shyre & wylshyre / and draweth with hym many other welles and stremes / and wexeth grete at Grecestre / and passeth forth than towarde Hampton / & so forth by Oxford / by wallynforde / by Redynge / and by London.  Wilhel. de pon. ca .ij. At the hauen of Sandwytche it falleth in to the eest see / and holdeth his name .xl. myle beyonde London / & departeth in some place Kent and Essex / westsex & Mercia / that is as it were a grete dele of myddle Englonde  R. Seuarne is a ryuer of Brytayn / & is called Haberne in brytysshe / and hath that name Haberne of Haberne y• was Estryldes doughter. Guendolon y• quene drowned this Haberne therin / therfore the brytons called y• ryuer Haberne after y• woman y• was drowned therin / but by corrupte latyn it is called Sabrina / Seuarne in englysshe. Seuarne begynneth in the myddle of Wales / & passeth fyrst towarde y• eest vnto Shrowesbury / & than turneth southwarde vnto Brygnorth / worcestre & Glocestre / & falleth in to the west see besydes Brystowe and departeth in some place Englonde & Wales.  Wilhel. de pom .li .iij. Seuarne is swyfte of streme / moche fysshe is ther in / woodnes of the swolowynge & of the whyrlynge water casteth vp & gadre to hepe grete hepes of grauell. Seuarne ofte aryseth & ouerfloweth the bankes.  R. Humbre hath that name of Humbre kyng of Hunes / for he was drowned therin / & renneth fyrst a croke out of the south syde of yorke / & than it departeth the prouynce of Lyndesey y• longed somtyme to the Merces from the other coumtre Northumberlonde.

THe kyngdome of Brytayne was somtyme made fayre wt .xxviij. noble citees wtout ryght many castelles that were walled wt coures / with gates and wt barres strongly buylded.  A fre.

Other citees ben foumde in cro   nycles for vnderstandynge of storyes / of whom it shall folowe.  W hel. de pon. London is a ryall and a ryche cite vpon Tamyse / of burgeyses / of riches of marchauntes / of chaffre and marchaumdyse. Therfore it is that somtyme wham derth of vytayles is in all Englonde / comyuly at London it is best chepe / bycause of the byers & sellers y• ben at London.  Gaufre. Brute y• fyrst kyng of Brytons buylded &  dyfyed this  te of London y• fyrst cite / in remembraumce of the cite of Troy that was destroyed / and called it Troy neweth & Trinouantum / yt is newe Troy Afterward kyng Lud called it Caerlud after his own name / therfore y• Brytons had indigna yon as Gyldas telleth. Afterward Englysshmen called y• cite London / & yet after that Normans called it Londres / & is named in latyn Lo¯do a. Rudhudibras kyng Leyles sone was y• vu . kyng of Brytons / he buylded Caumterbury the chefe cite of Kent / & called it Caerkent. Afterward Englysshmen called it Doro ernia / but yt is not Douer yt standeth vpon y• clif of y• frensshe see / & is from this Douer .xii. englysshe myle. Afterward this Dorober a was & is called Caumterbury. The same king Rudhudibras buylded Wynchestre / & called it Caerguent / & after Englysshmen called it went / & wynchestre after the name of one Wyne an Englysshman yt was bysshop there. All westsaxon was subiecte to hy¯ / the same kyng buylded Paladour that is Septon yt now is called Shaftesbury. Britons tellen yt an egle {pro} he yed there somtyme. Bladud Leyles sone a  ygromancer was the .ix. kyng of Brytons / he buylded Bathe / & called it Caerbathon. Englisshmen called it after Athamannus cite. But at y• last men called it Bathonia y• is Bathe.  Wilhel. de pom.   .ij. In this cite welleth vp & springeth   bath s / & men wene y• Iulius Cezar made there suche bathes.  R. But Gaufre. monemutensis in his brytysshe boke saith yt Bladud made those bathes bycause William hath not seen that brytysshe boke wrote so by tellynge of other men / or by his own gessyng as he wrote other thynges not best auysedly. Therfore it semeth more sothly that Bladud made not y• hote bathes / ne Iuli{us} Cezardyd suche a dede / though Bladud buylded & made the cite / but it accordeth better to kyndly reason yt the water renneth in the erth by vaynes of brymstone & sulphur / & so it is kyndly made hote in that course & spryngeth vp in dyuers places of y• cite. And so there ben hote bathes yt wasshen of teters / sores & scabbes  Treuisa. Though men might by crafte make hote bathes for to endure longe ynough this accordeth well to reason & to philosophy y• treateth of hote welles & bathes that ben in diuers londes / though y• water of this bath be more troubly & sourer of sauour and of smell than other hote bathes ben that I haue seen at Acon in Almayn. And eyges in Sauoye whiche ben fayre & clere as ony well streme / I haue ben bathed therin & assayed them.  R. Claudi{us} Cezar maryed his doughter to Aruiragus kyng of Britons. This Claudius Cezar buylded Glocestre in y• wedding of his doughter. Britons called this cite fyrst after Claudius name / but afterward it was called Glocestre after one Gloria whiche was duke of y• coumtre & sta¯deth vpon Seuarne in y• marche of Englo¯de & wales. Shrowesbury is a cite vpon Seuerne in y• marche of englo¯de & wales / & is set vpon y• toppe of an hyll & it is called Shrowesbury of shrobbes & fruyte yt grewe there somtyme o  yt hyll. Brytons called it somtyme Pengwerne that is y• heed of a fayre tree. Shrowesbury was somtyme y• heed of Powesye that stretcheth forth toward ouer y• myddell   of wales vnto ye Irysshe see. Notyngham standeth vpon Trent / & somtyme hyght Notyngham yt is ye wonnynge of dennes / for ye Danes dwelled there somtyme & dygged dennes and caues vnder harde stones & rockes & dwelled there.  R. Lyncolne is chefe of ye prouynce of Lyndesey / & was called somtyme Caerludcoit / & afterwarde Lyndecoln. It is vncertayne who buylded fyrst this cyte but yf it were ky¯g Lud: & so it semeth by menynge of ye name / for caer is britysshe & is to saye a cite / & coit is a wode / & so it semeth yt Caerludcoit is to saye Luddes wode towne. Ky¯g Leir was Bladuddes sone & buylded Leyce tre / as it were in ye myddle of Englonde vpon ye ryuer Sos and vpon Fosse the kynges hye waye.  Wilhel. de pon. lib .iij. yOrke is a grete cite in eyther syde of ye water of Ouse that semed as fayre as Rome vnto the tyme that kyng Willyam had wt brennynge & fyre defouled it & the coumtree aboute / so that a pylgrym wolde now wepe and he sawe it / yf he had knowen it tofore.  Gaufre. Ebrancus the .v. kyng of Britons buylded yorke & called it after his own name Caerbranke. He buylded also two other citees / one in Scotlo¯de & is called Edenburgh / & an other toward Scotlonde in the ende of Englonde & is called Alcliud.  R. Edenburgh is a cite in the londe of Pictes bytwene ye ryuer of Twede & the scottysshe see / & hyght somtyme ye castell of Maydens / & was called afterwarde Edenburgh of Edan kynge of Pictes / yt regned there in Egfridus tyme kyng of Northumberlonde. Alcliud was somtyme a noble cite / & is now well nygh vnknowen to all Englysshmen. For vnder the Brytons & Pictes & Englysshmen it was a noble cite to ye comynge of the Danes. But afterward about ye yere of our lorde viij .C .lxx. it was destroyed whan ye danes destroyed the coumtree of Northumberlonde. But in what place of Britayn that cite Alcliud was buylded / auctours tell diuersly. Beda li .j. sayth that it was buylded by west that arme of ye see that departeth bytwene the Britons and the Pictes somtyme there Seuer{us} famous wall endeth westward / and so it semeth by hym that it is not ferre from Ca le ll for that cite is set at the ende of the wall. Other wryters of storyes wryte that ye cite of Alcliud is that cite that now is called Aldburgh / yt is to saye / an olde towne / & standeth vpon the ryuer Ous not ferre fro Burghbrigge / that is .x. myle westward out of yorke / & it semeth that he preueth that by Gaufride in his boke of dedes of Brytons / he wryteth yt  durus kynge of Britons was lodged at the cite of Alcliud bycause of so a e and huntynge / & founde his broder Arga on maskynge in a wode nygh there b  that hyght Calatery / but that w d   latery whiche is Calters in   recheth almoost to yorke / and str eth towarde ye north by Aldburgh   by space of .xx. myle / ye moost   of that wode is now throwen down & the   tylled. Other men wolde suppose yt Alcliud was that cyte that now is called Burgham in the north coumtree of w  merlonde fast by Comberlond and standeth vpon ye riuer Eden the cite is   wondersly seen. Deme ye now where it is buylded.  Tre sa. It is not harde to assoyle yf men take hede that many townes bere one name as Cartag  in Affrica & Cartago in spayne. Newporte in wales & Newport in ye parysshe of Barkeley / Worten vnder egge & worton passeth / wy war wyk payne & wyk in ye parysshe of Barkeley / & two shyre townes eyther is called Hampton / as Southampton & Northampton so it semeth by   the storyes that one Alcliud was in York shyre / an other in westmerlo¯d / & one fast by the ryght syde of y• west arme of y• see that departeth Englonde & Scotlonde / But yt Alcliud was a ryght stronge cyte as Beda sayth / & y• cyte standeth fast by a ryuer yt is called Cliud / & there is not suche a ryuer in Yorkshyre nor in Westmerlonde as men of the coumtree tell me. Some men saye that the ryuer Cliud is now named Sulwatche. Sulwatche is but .v.   fro Caerleyll / whiche is a cite in y•  oumtre of north Englond toward y• north west / & hath an other name / whiche is Luguball. Leyll the .vij. kynge of Britons buylded Caerleyll.  R. In this cite is som what of yt famous wall that passeth Northumberlond.  Wi hel. de pon. In this cite is yet a thre chambred hous made of vawte stones that neuer myght be destroyed wt tempest of wederne wt brennynge of fyre. Also in y• coumtree fast by westmerlonde in y• front of a thre chambred place is wryte¯ in this maner Mar   ictori. what this wrytyng is to saye I doubte somwhat / but yf it were so yt some of y• Combres laye there somtyme whan y• consull Mari{us} had put hy¯ out of  taly. But it semeth better yt it is wryten in mynde of Mari{us} kyng of Britons yt was Aruitag{us} sone. This Mari{us} ouer ame in that place Rodryk kynge of Pictes / so sayth Gaufre in his brytysshe  oke / William malmes ury sawe neuer y• boke. At Hagulstaldes chirche is a place .lxxx. myle out of york northwestward the place is as it were destroyed / so saith Wi hel .li .iij. de pon  That place longed somtyme to y• bisshopriche of York / there were somtyme houses wt vyce arches & bautes in y• mane  of Rome / now yt place is called Hestoldesham & Heglesham also Beda  .  . ca.  . saith that y• place is fast by y• longe wall of the werke of Rome in the north halfe.  R. There is difference bytwene the prouynce of Lindefar & the chirche Lindefarne. For the prouynce of Lyndefar & Lyndesey is all one / & lyeth by eest Lyncolne / & Lincolne is the heed therof / of the whiche sayth Beda li .iiij. ca .xj. that Sexuulfus was first bisshop there. But Beda lib .iiij. ca .xxiij. sayth y• Lyndefar chirche is an ylond yt is called holy ylonde in the ryuer of Twede nexte Barwyk. And so it is gadred of Bedaes sawes yt Twede renneth in to y• famous arme of y• see y• now departeth Englyssh men & Scottes in y• eest halfe / & in that arme be¯ thre ylondes / yt one is Maylros that now is called Menros. Than about toward the west is Lyndefarne chirche that is called holy ylo¯de. Than ye thyrde is aboue vpward / & is the yloude Far e & is called also Feruy ylonde. Than vpwarde aboue that two myle is a ryall cite vpon y• brynke of Twede whiche som tyme hight Bebamburgh yt is Bobbes cite / & now is called Bamburgh / & hath a ryght stronge castell.  Gir. in itinere Two  ytees there ben eyther is called Caerlegyon & Caerleon also / one is De ecia in south wales that is called Caeruske / also there the ryuer of Vske falleth in to Seuerne fast by Glamorgan. Bellin{us} king of Britons somtyme buylded that cite / & was somtyme the chefe cyte of Demecia in south wales. Afterwarde in Claudius  esars tyme it was called y• cite Legyons whan at y• prayer of Genius the quene / Vaspasianus and Aruirag{us} were accorded / & Legyons of Rome were sent in to Irlonde / tho was Caerleon a noble cyte & of grete auctorite / and by the Romayns ryally buylded and walled about with walles of brent tyle. Grete noblesse yt was there in olde tyme is there yet in many places seen / as the grete palayses / gyaumtes toures / noble bathes /  eleef of y• temples places of the atrees / that were places hygh &   ryall to stande and syt in / and to beholde about. The places were  yally closed wt ryall walles that yet so dele standeth  yght nygh close. And within y• walles and without is grete buyldynge vndererth / water co¯duytes and wayes vndererth / & stewes also y• shalte se wonderly made wt strayte syde wayes of brethyng that wonderly cast vp hete. In this cite were somtyme thre noble chirches / one was of saynt Iulius y• martyr / & therin a grete company of virgins. That other was of saynt Aaron that was of y• ordre of blacke chauons / yt chirche was ryght nobly aourned. The thyrd chirche was the chefe moder chirche of all Wales / & the chefe see. But after warde y• chefe see was turned out of that cite in to Meneuia / that is saynt Dauids londe in west wales. In this Caerleon was Amphibal{us} borne yt taught saynt Albon. There y• messengers of Rome came to grete Arthurs courte / yf it is le ull to byleue Treui a / yf Girald{us} was in doubte whether it were lefull to byleue or not  it were a wonder shewynge as men wolde wene for to haue euermore in mynde & euer be in doubte yf all his  okes were suche / what lore were therin / & namely whyle he maketh none euyden e / for in neyther syde he telleth what ineueth hym so to saye.  R. There is an other cite of Legyons there his Cronyeles were betrauayled as it is clerely knowen by y• fyrst tha tre of this boke.  Tr uisa. That is to vnderstande in the la yn wrytyng. For he y• made it in latyn turned it not in to Englisshe in y• same place that it was first in la yn. The vnderstandyng of hy¯ that made this Crony les is thus wryten in latyn in y• begy¯nynge of this boke Presentem Cronican  comp auit frat r Ranulph{us} Cestren s monachus. That is to say  in Englisshe. Broder Ranulph mon e of Chestre compyled & made this boke of the Cr ny es.   . The cite of Legions that is Chestre  tandeth in the Marche of Englonde toward Wales by twene two armes of the see y•   named De & Mersee. This cite in tym  of Brytons was heed & chefe cite of a cia / that is Northwales. The  oumder of this cite is vnknowen. For who y•  eeth the foumdementes of y• grete  ones wold rather wene y• it were Romayns we ke or werke of gyauntes / than it were   by werkynge of Britons. This   somtyme in Britysshe sp che hyght Ca  leon / Legecestria in latyn / & Chestre   Englysshe / & y• cite of Legyons also. For there laye a wynter y• legyons of knyghtes that Iulius Cezar sent for to wynne Irlond. And after Claudius Cezar sent Legyons out of that cite for to w nne y• ylonde yt he called Or ades. What euer Wyllyam Ma mesbury by tell nge of other men mente of this cite. This   hath p te of lyuelode / of come of  esshe of fysshe / & spe yally of pryce of samon. This cite  yueth grete marcha se and sendeth out also. Also nygh this cite ben salt welles / metall &  . Northumbrers destroyed this cite somtyme. But afterward El eda lady of M   ded it agayn / & made it moche mor . In this same cite ben wayes vnder the   with vawtes & stone werke wonderly wrought / thre chambre werkes / grete stones grauen with olde mennes names therin. There is also Iulius C ars name wonderly grauen in stone and other noble m nes also wt the wrytyng about. This is the cite that Ethe ide kyng of Northumberlonde destroyed / and  we there fast by nygh two thousande monkes of the mynster of Bangor. This is the cite that kynge Edgar came thyder somtyme wt .vij. ky ge  y• were  u g  to hym. I metre breketh out in this maner in pray yng this cit . Chestre  castell   towne / as it were / name taketh of a castell. It is vnknowen what man buylded this cite now. Tho legecestria chees hyght now towne of Legyones. Now Waisshe and Englisshe holde this cite of grete pryce. Stones on walles semeth werke Hercules all. There longe with myght / to dure yt hepe is hyght. Saxon small stones / set vpon grete ben at ones. There vnder grounde / lotynge double voute is foumde. That helpeth wt sondes many men of westerne londes. Fysshe flesshe and corne lowe / this Cite towne hath ynowe. Shyppes & chaffare / see water bry¯geth ynough thare. Godestal there is / that was Emperour or this. And forth Henry kynge / erthe is there dwellynge. Of kynge Haralde / powder is there yet y halde. Bachus and Mercurius / Mars and Venus. Also Lauerna / Protheus and Pluto / regne there in the towne.  Treuisa. God wote what this is to mene / but poetes in theyr maner speche fayne as though euery kynde crafte & lyuynge had a dyuers god eueryche from other. And so they fayned a god of batayle & of fyghtyng & called hy¯ Mars / and a god of couetyse & richesse & marchaumdyse / & called hym Mercurius And so Bachus is called god of wyne.  enus goodesse of loue & beaute. Lauer ua god of theire & of robbery. Protheus god of falshede & of gyle / & Pluto god of hell. And so it semeth that these verses wolde mene that these foresayd goddes regne & ben serued in Chestre. Mars wt fyghtyng & cockynge. Mercurius with couetyse & rychesse. Bachus with grete dry¯kyng. Venus wt loue lewdly. Lauerna wt thefre & robbery. Procheus wt faishede & gyle. Than is Pluto not vnserued that is god of hell.  R. There Babylon lore / more myght hath trouth the more.  Of prouynces and Shyres. Ca .x. TAke hede that Englonde conteyneth .xxxij. shyres & prouynces / yt now ben called erledomes / reserued Cornewayle & yt ylonde.  Alfre. These ben the names of yt erledomes & shires. Kent Southsex / Sothery / Namshyre / Barok shyre that hath his name of a bare oke yt is in the forest at wyndsore / for at yt bare oke men of that shyre were wont to come togyder and make theyr treatyes / and there take coumseyle & aduyse. Also Wylshyre that hight somtyme the prouynce of Semera¯ / Somerset / Dorset / Deuen shyre / that now is called Deuonia in latyn. These .ix. south shyres the Tamyse departeth from the other dele of Englonde which were somtyme gouerned & ruled by the westsaxons lawe. Eestsex / Myddelsex / Southsex / Northfolke / Herford shyre / Huntyngdon shyre / Northamton shyre / Cambrydge shyre / Bedfordshyre / Boky¯gham shyre / Leycestre shyre / Der by shyre / Notyngham shyre / Lyncolne shyre / Yorkeshyre / Durham shyre / Northumberlonde / Caerleylshyre / wt Cumberlonde / Appelbyshyre / with Westmer londe / Lancastre shyre that conteyncth fyue lytell shyres. These .xv. North and Eest shyres were somtyme gouerned & ruled by the lawe called Mercia in latyn & Marchene lawe in Englysshe. It is to wyte that Yorke shyre stretcheth from yt ryuer of Humber vnto yt ryuer of Teyse And yet in Yorke shyre ben .xxij. hondredes / hondred & candrede is all one. Candrede is one worde made of walssue and Irysshe / & is to menynge a coumtree that conteyneth an hondred townes / & is also in Englysshe called wepentake / for somtyme in the comynge of a newe lorde tenaumtes were wont to yelde vp theyr wepen in stede of homage. Durhamshyre stretcheth from the ryuer of Teyse vnto yt riuer of Tyne. And for to speke properly of Northumberlond it stretcheth fro the   ryuer of   unto the ryuer of T o de That is in ye begynnyngs of ScotlondeTha  y  y• co tree of North mberlonde that was somtyme from  umber unto Twe e be now accounted for one shyre & one   / as it was   yine. Than ben in Englond but .xxii. shyres / but yf the countre of Northumberionde be departed in to .vi. shyres yt ben Euerwyke shyre / Durhamshyre / Norchumberlo¯de Cuerleilshyre / Appelbyshyre / Laucastre shyre / than ben in englo¯de .xxxvi. shyres without Cornewayle / & also without yt ylondes. Kynge William made all these prouynces and shyres to be descryued & meue. Than were foumden .xxxvi. shyres and halfe a shyre. Townes .iii. M. and soure score. Parysshe churches .xivi. M. and two. knyghtes fees .ixxv. thousande / wherof men of religyon haue .xxvij. thousande and .xv. any ghtes fees. But now the wodes ben hewen towne and the londe newe tylled / and made moche more than was at that tyme / and many townes & vyllages buyiden / & so there be many moo vyllages &   now than were at that tyme. And where as afore is wryten that Cornewayle is not fet amonge the shyres of Englonde / it may stande amonge them well ynough for it is neyther in wales nor in Scotlonde / but it is in Englonde / & it loyneth vnto Deuenshyre / & so may there be accounted in Englonde .xxxvii. shyres and an hath with the other shyles.  Oelegibus legum  vocabulis. OVnwall  that hight Mo in a{us} also made fyrste  a es in Brytayne / ye whiche is   lawes / & were   vnto Willyam Conque s   his   that lede men therto / and p owe men solowes sholde haue preuylege & fredome for to saue all men that wolde flee therto for sorour and refuge. Than afterward Mercia quene of Brytous yt was Gwyl telinus wyfe / of her the prouynce had yt name of Mercia as some men suppose. She made a lawe full of wytte & reason and was called Merchene lawe.  Gyis das that wrote the Cronyeles and hysto ryes of the Brytons / turned these two lawes out of Brytons speche in to laryn. And afterward kynge Aluredus turned all out of latyn in to Saxons speche / and was called Merchene lawe. Also yt same kynge Aluredus wrote in Englysshe / & put to another lawe yt hyght westsaron lawe. Than afterwarde Danis were lordes in this londe / & so came forth the thyrde lawe that hyght Dane lawe. Of these threlawes saynt Edward yt thyrd made one comyn lawe / that yet is called saynt Edwardes lawe. I holde it will done to wryte & expowne many termes of these lawes. Myndebruch hurtyng of honour & worshyp. In irenssbe blesc ur de honnour. Burbruck in frenside dieschur de tourt ou de cioys. Grithburche brekyng of peas. Mylkennynge chaungynge of speche in courte.

THe kyngdome of Brytayne stode without departynge hole and all one kyngdome to the Brytons / from the fyrst Brute vnto Julius Cezars tyme / and fro Julius Cezars tyme vnto Seuerus tyme this londe was vnder trybute to yt Romayns. Neuerthelesse kynges they had of yt same londe from Seuerus vnto the last prynce Gracian successours of Brytayn fayled / and Romayns regned in Brytayn. Afterwarde the Romayns lefte of theyr regnynge in Brytayne / bycause it was fetre from Rome and for grete besynes that they had on yt other syde. Than Scottes and Pietes by mysledynge of Maximus the tyraumt pursued Brytayn / & warred there with grete strengthe of men of armes longe tyme / vnto the tyme that the Saxons came at the prayenge of the Brytons agaynst the Pictes / & put out Gurmond the Irysshe kyng with his Pictes / and the Brytons also with theyr kynge that hight Careticus / and droue them out of Englond into Wales. And so yt Saxons were vyctoryous / & euery prouynce after his strength made hym a kyng. And so departed Englonde in to seuen kyngdomes. Neuerthelesse afterwarde these seue¯ kyngdomes euerychone after other   all in to one kyngdome. All hole vn   the prynce Adelstoue. Neuerthelesse    nes pursued this londe fro Adei  tyme that was Alurents fader vnto the thy  abouts au .C .lxx.    lly therin .xxil.  re And after hym Haralde h lde the kyngdome .ix. mouethes. And after hym. Nor mans haue regned vnto this tyme / but how longe they shall regue he to whome no thynge is vnknowen.    Of yt foresayd seuen kyngdomes & theyr markes mares & boundes / whan they began / & how longe they endured / here shall I somwhat shortly tell.  Alfre. The fyrst kyngdome was yt kyngdome of Kent / yt stretcheth fro the eest Occean vnto yt ryuer of Tamyse. There regned the fyrst Engystes / & began to regne by the accountynge of Dionyse the yere of our lorde A .C .lv. that kyngdome dured iii .C .lviij. yere .xv. kinges / vnto yt tyme that kynge Baldrede was put out / and Egbert kynge of westsaxon ioyned that kyngdom to his owne. The second kyng dome was at Southsaxon / that had in the eest syde kent / in the south the see & the yle of wyght / in the west Hamshyre & in the north sothery / there Ella regned fyrst wt his thre sones / & began to regne the yere after the comynge of yt Angles euen .xxx. But that kyngdome within shorte tyme passed in to the other kyngdomes. The thyrde kyngdome was of Eestsaxon / & bad in the eest syde the see / in the west the coumtree of London / in the fouth Temse / & in yt north Southfolke. The kynges of this coum  of westsaron fro the first Sebertes tyme vnto yt tyme of the Danes were .x. kynges / the whiche were subgecte somdele to other kynges. Neuerthelesse o t est & longest they were vnder the kynges of Merci  / &   to the tyme y• Egbert the kynge of westsaxon ioyned y• kyngdome was to his owne. The fourth kyngdome was of Eest   gles / & conteyneth Northfolke & South folke / and hath in the east syde and in the   north syde the see / & in y• north west Cam bridge shyre / in y• west saynt Comondes dyche & Herfordshyre / & in y• south Essex. And this kyngdom duted vnder twelue kynges / vnto the tyme y• kyng Edmond was slayne. And than the Danes toke wrongfully both the kyngdomes of eest Angles and of eest Saxon. Afterwarde the Danes were put out and dryuenawaye / or made subgecte. And than the elder kynge Edwarde ioyned bothe the ky¯gdomes to his orane. The fyfth kyng dome was of westsaxon / & dured longest of all these kyngdomes / & had in the eest syde fouthsaxon / in the north Tamyse / in the south & in the west the see Occean In that kyngdome regned Serdryk wt his sone Kenryke / & began to regne the yere of our lorde god .v .C. and .xix. and than after the comynge of Angles .lxxi. so sayth Denys the other kyngdomes passed in to this kyngdome. The syxth kyngdome was of Mercia / & was gretest of all. The markes & the meres ther of were in the west syde of the ryuer De faste by Chestre / and Seuarne faste by Shrowesbury vnto Brystowe / in y• eest the eest see / in the south Tamyse vnto London / in the north the ryuer of Humber / and so westwarde and downwarde vnto the riuer Mersee vnto the corner of wyrhall / there Number falleth in to the west see. Penda Wyvves sone regned fyrst in this kyngdome in the yere of our lorde Jesu Chryst .vi. C .xxvi. soo sayth Denys / and fro the comynge of Angles an hondred .lxxv. yere. This kyngdome dured vnder .xviii. kynges aboute two hondred .lxiij. yere / vnto y• last Colwulfe the Danes vetoke y• kyngdome to kept whan Burdred the kyng was put out / but the elder Edward the kyng put out the Danes / and ioyned the kyngdom of Mercia to his owne kyngdome. Neuerthelesse at the begyunynge this kyngdome of Mercia was departed in to thre In west Mercia / in myddell Mercia / & eest Mercia. The .vij. kyngdome was Northamhymbro{rum} / yt is the kyngdome of Northumberionde / the meres & markes therof were by west & by cest the see of Occean / by south yt tyuer of Humber / and so downward toward the west by yt ende of the shyres of Notyngham and of Derby vnto the ryuer of Merses / and by north the Scottes see / that hyght forth in Scottes / weres in Britysshe / y• Scot tysshe see in Englysshe. This kyngdom of Northumberlonde was fyrst deied in two prouynces. That one was y• south syde & hyght Deyra / & that other was y• north syde & hyght Brenicia / as it were two kyngdomes / & the ryuer departed these two kyngdomes that tyme / for the kyngdome of Deyra was from y• ryuer of Humber vnto the ryuer of Tyne. The kyngdome of Brenicia was fro Tyne to the Scottysshe see. And whan Pirres dwelled there as Beda sayth li .iij. ca .ii. That Ninian y• holy man co¯uetted men of the south syde. Ida the kynge regned there fyrst / & began to regne the yere of our lorde .v .C. & .xlvij. so sayth Denys. In Deyra regned kyng Elle the yere of our lorde .v. C .xlix. These two kyngdomes were other whyle (as it is sayd) departed bytwene two kinges / & somtyme all hole vnder one kyng / and dured as it were .xx. Englysshe kynges .CCC .xxi. yere. At y• last Osbartus and Elle were slayne in the .ix. yere of theyr kyngdome the Danes slewe them / & Northumberlonde was voyde wtout kynge .viii. yere Than afterwarde the Danes regned in Northumberlonde .xxxvi. yere / vnto the onynge of y• kyngdome. Adeistone made subgecte the kynges / Danes / scottysshe & walsshe / & regned fyrst alone in Englonge / & helde y• kyngdome of Englonde all hole and all one kyngdome / that was   the yere of our lorde. viij .C .xxviij. That tyuer of Mer ee was somtyme marke & mere bytwene the kyngdome of Mercia and the kyngdome of Northumberlond that may be shewed in two maners / first by this properte of this Mersee / that is as moche to saye as a see y• is a boumde & a mere / for it departeth one kyngdome from an other. Also it is wryten in Cronycles of Henry & Alfrede y• kyng Edward y• elder fastned a castell at Ma¯cestre in Northumberlond / but y• cite Ma¯cestre is fro the tyuer of Mersee scarsely thre myle.  Of bysshopryches and of theyr sees. Ca .xiij. IVrius was the fyrst kyng chrystened of y• Brytons / in his tyme were thre archebysshoppes sees in Brytayne / oue was at London / an other at yorke / & the thyrde at Cacrusk the cite of Legyons in Glamorgan / that cite is now called Caerleon. To these archebisshops sees were subge te .xxviij. bysshops / & were called Flammes. To the archebysshops see of London was subgecte Corne wayle & all myddell Englo¯de vnto Humber. To yorke all Northumberlonde from the bowe of Humber with all Scotlo¯de. To Caerleon all Wales / there were in wales .vij. bisshops / & now ben but .iiij. Tho Seuarne departed Englonde and Wales.  Withel. de pon. lib .iij. But in the Saxons tyme / though saynt Gregory had granted London the preuilege of the archebysshops see / neuertheles saint Austyn that was sent in to Englonde by saynt Gregory turned y• archebysshops  e out of London in to Caumterbury. After saynt Gregoryes days at y• prayer of kyng Ethe bryght & citezyns & burgeyses of cauterbury / there y• archebisshops see hath   vnto now / saue that in y•   tyme Offa kyng of Mercia was   men of Caunterbury / & bena  them y• worship / & worshypped Adulphe bisshop of Lychfeld wt the arch bisshops pall by assent of Adrian y• pope vpon case by gyftes sent. Neuertheles vnder Kenulphe y• kyng it was restored to Caunterbury agayn. The worshyp of y• see of yorke hath dured there alway & yet dureth / though Scotlond be withdrawen fro his subgeccion by passynge of tyme.  Gir. in it inere li .j. The archebisshops see was turned out of Caerleon i to Meneuia / that is in y• west syde of Demi i  vpon the Irysshe see in saynt Dauyds tyme vnder kynge Arthur. From saynt Dauyds tyme vnto Sampsons tyme were in Meneuia .xxiij. archebysshops. Afterward fell a pestylence in all Wales of y• yelowe euyll / y• is called the Iaumdys And than Sampson y• archebysshop toke with hym y• pall & went in to Brytayne Armonica y• lesse Brytayn / & was there bisshop of Dolensis / from y• tyme vnto y• fyrst Hentyes tyme kynge of Englonde were at Meneuia whiche is called saint Dauids .xxi. bysshops all without pall / whether it were for vncunnynge or for pouerte. Neuertheles alway fro y• tyme the bysshops of Wales were satted of y• bysshop of Meneuia of saynt D uyds / & the bysshop of Meneuia was sacred of y• bysshops of Wales as of his suffrigans & made no {pro}fessyon ne subgeccio¯ to none other chirche. Other bysshops y• came afterwarde were sacred at Caumterbury by co¯pellyng & h est of y• kynge / in token of y• sacrynge & subgeccyon / Boniface archebysshop of Caumterbury y• was legate of the Crosse songe in euery Cathedrall chirche of Wales solempnely. Amas he was y• fyrst arch bisshop of Caumterbury that so did in Wales / & that was done in the second Henryes tyme.   . But now ben but two prymates in all Englonde / of Caunterbury & of Yorke. To the prymate of Caunterbury ben subgecte .xiij.   bysshops in Englonde and .iiij. in wales The prymate of yorke hath but two suf frigans in Englonde / y• ben y• bisshops of Caer yl & of Durham. Of all these sees and chaungynge of theyr places I shall shewe you here folowyng. Take hede in the begyunynge of holy chirche in Englo¯de bysshops ordeyned theyr sees in lowe places & symple y• were  ou nable for co¯ templacyon / for prayers & deuocyon. But in Willyam conquerours tyme by dome of lawe canon it was ordeyned that bysshops   come out of small townes in to grete  tees / therfore was y• see of Dor chestre  haumged to Lyncolne. Lychfelde to Chestre. Tetford to Norwiche. Shyr borne to Salysbury. Welles to Bathe. Cornewayle to Excestre / and Selesey to Chychestre. The bysshop of Rochestre hath no parysshe / but he is the archebysshops chapelayn of Caumterbury. Sith y• see of Ca erbury was first ordeyned by say¯t Austin / it chaumged yet neuer his place.

After that Agilbert was put out of Wynchestre / y• tho hyght Wynton / than was there an Englysshe bysshop y• was calle  Wyne. Some men suppose y• this cite hath the name of this Wyne / and is called Wynchestre / as it were wyne cite. At y• last he was put out / & after hym came Leutherius y• foresayd Ag berts neuewe. After Leuthert{us} Hedda a whyle was bysshop there / whan he was deed Theodorus y• archebysshop ordeyned two bysshops to the {pro}uince of westsaxon.

At y• last by commandement of kyng Willyam conquerour all these sees (sau  wynchestre) were turned & chaumged out of small townes in to grete Cytees / for Shyrborne and Kammesbury were turned in to Salysbury. Now to that see is subgecte Barkshyre / wylshyre & Dorset The see of welles was turned to Bathe therto is now subgecte all Somers .

And so ben but two prymates in Englonde / what of them shall do to the other / & in what mener poynt he shal be obedyent & vnder hym / it is fully conteyned within about y• yere of our  lord  god M .lxxij. tofore y• fyrst kynge Willyam & the bysshops of Englonde by commaundement of y• pope the cause was handled & treated bytwene the foresayd prymates & ordeyned & demed that the prymate of Yorke shal be subgecte to the prymate of Caumterbury in thynges y• l ngen to the worship of god & to y•  yleue of holy chirche / so that in what place so euer it be in Englonde y• the prymate of Caumterbury   holde & constrayne to gader a counseyle of clergye the pry ate of Yorke is holden wt his suffrygans for to be there & for to be obedyent to y• ordinaunce that there shall be lawfully ordeyned.

After aboute the yere of our lorde .xi. C .lxxxxv. in y• t  of kyng Rycharde ben reasons set for y• ryght party for eyther prymate / & what one prymate dyd to y• other in tyme of Thurstinus of Thomas and of other bisshops of Yorke from the conquest vnto kynge Henryes tyme y• thyrde. Also there it is sayd how eche of them starte from other. This place is but a forspekynge & not a full treatyse therof / therfore it were noyful to charge this place with all suche reasons.  Of how many maner of people haue dwelled therin. Ca .xiiij. BRitons dwelled first in this ylond the .xviij. yere of Hely y• prophete the .xj. yere of Solinus postam{us} kynge of Latyns .xiiij. yere after the takyng of Troy /  ofore y• buyldynge of Rome.  c .xxij. yere.   . They came hyther & toke theyr   from Armonyk that now is that other Brytayne / they helde longe tyme the s  coumtrees of y•  . It b fe  afterwarde in  aspa  tyme duke of Rome / y• the P etes shypped out of   in to   / and were dryuen aboute w  wynde / & entred in to the north co  of Irlonde / and foumde there S ttes / & prayed them to haue a place to dwell in / and myght    one gete. For Irlonde as Scottes sayd myght not sustayne bothe people. Scottes sente the Pictes to the north syde of Englo¯de & behyght them helpe agaynst the Brytons y• were theyr enemyes / yf they wolde aryse / & toke them wyues of theyr doughters / vpon suche condicyon yf doubte fell / who sholde haue ryght to be kynge / they sholde rather chose hy¯ of the moders side than of y• faders syde / of the women kynne rather than of y• men kynne.  Gaufre. In Vaspasyan y• emperours tyme whan Mari{us} Aruiragus sone was kyng of Brytons / one Rodryk kyng of Pictes came out of Scicia & began to destroye Scotlonde. Marius the kyng slewe this Rodryk / & gaue y• north party of Scotlonde y• hight Cathenesia to the men that were come with Rodryk & were ouercome by hym / for to dwell in But these men had no wyues / ne none myght haue of y• nacion of Bryto¯s / ther fore they sayled in to Irlonde / & toke to theyr wyues Irysshe mennes doughters by y• couenaumt that y• moders blode shold be put tofore in successyon of herytage.  Gir. ca .xvij. Neuertheles Sirin{us} su{per} Virgiliumsayth y• Pictes agatirses y• had some dwellyng place about y• waters of Scicia / & they ben called Pictes of peyntynge & smytynge of woundes / therfore they are called Pictes as peynted men. These men and these gothes ben all one people. For whan Maximus the tyraumt was gone out of Brytayne in to Fraumce for to occupy y• empyre. Than Gracian{us} and Valentinianus y• were bretherne & felowes of the empyre brought these gothes out of Scicia wt grete gyftes / wt flaterynge & fayre byhestes in to the north coumtree of Brytayne. For they were stalworth & stronge men of armes. And so these theues and brybouts were made men of londe & of coumtre & dwelled in the north coumtre / & helde there cytees & townes.  Gaufre. Carancius the tyraunt slewe Bassianus / and gaue the Pictes a dwellyng place in Albama that is Scotlonde / there they dwelled longe tyme afterward & medled with Brytons.   . Than sith the Pictes occupyed fyrst the north syde of Scotlonde / it semeth y• the dwellynge place y• this Carancius gaue them is y• south syde of Scotlonde / that stretcheth from the thwarte ouer walle of Romayns werke to y• Scottysshe see / and conteyneth Galleway and Lodouia that is Lodeway.  Therfore Bede  .iij. ca .ij. speketh in this maner. N an the holy man conuerted y• south Pictes. Afterward the Saxons came & made y• coumtre longe to Brenicia the north party of Northumberlonde / vnto y• tyme that Kynadius Alpinus sone kynge of Scotlonde put out y• Pictes / & made y• coumtre that lyeth bytwene Twede & the Scottysshe see long to his kyngdom.  Beda li .j. ca .j. Afterwarde longe tyme y• Scottes were led by duke Renda / & came out of Irlonde that is the propre countre of Scottes / & with loue or with strengthe made them a place fast by the Picces in the north syde of the arme of the see that breketh in to the londe in the west syde / that departed in olde tyme bytwene Britons & Pictes. Of this duke Renda the Scottes had y• name & were called Dalrendin{us} / as it were Rendaes parte / for in theyr speche a parte is called dal.  Gir. pri. The Pictes myght haue no wyues of Brytons / but they toke them wyues of Iryssh Scottes / and promysed them fayre for to dwell with them / & graumted them a londe by y• see syde / there y• see is narowe. That londe is now called Galleway. Marianus. Irysshe Scottes londed at Argall y• is Scottes clyf for Scottes londed there for to do harme to y• Britons / or for y• place is next to Irlo¯d for to come a londe in Brytayn.  Beda. And   so the Scottes after y• Britons & Pictes made y• thyrde people dwellynge in Brytayn.  R. Than after y• came y• Saxons at the prayenge of the Brytons to helpe them agaynst y• Scottes & Pictes. And the Britons were soone put out in to wales / & Saxons occupyed the londe lytell & lytell / & efte more to the Scottysshe see And so Saxons made the fourth maner of men in y• ylonde of Brytayn.  Beda lib .v. ca .ix. For Saxons & Angles came out of Germania / yet some Bryto¯s that dwel nygh call them shortly Germayns  R. Neuertheles aboute y• yere of our lorde. viij .C. Egbartus kynge of Westsaxon commaumded & bad al men call y• men of y• londe Englysshmen.  Alfre. Than after that the Danes pursued the londe aboute a. ij .C. yere / that is to saye / fro y• foresayd Edbartus tyme vnto saynt Edwardes tyme / & made y• fyfth maner of people in y• ylonde / but they fayled after warde. At the last came Normans vnto duke Willyam & subdued Englysshmen & yet kepe they y• londe / & they made the syxth people in y• ylonde. But in the fyrst kynge Henryes tyme came many Flemynges & receyued a dwelly¯ge place for a tyme besyde Maylros in the west syde of Englonde / & made the seuenth people in the ylonde. Neuertheles by commaumdement of the same kynge they were put thens & dryuen to Hauerfordes syde in y• west syde of wales.  R. And so now in Brytayn Danes & Pictes fayle all out / and fyue nacyons dwell therin / that ben Scottes in Albania / that is Scotlonde. Brytayne in Cambria / y• is Wales / but that Flemynges dwell in / y• is west Wales. And Normans & Englysshmen ben medled in al y• ylo¯de / for it is now doubte in storyes how and in what maner they were put away & destroyed out of Brytayn. Now it is to declare how y• Pictes were destroyed & fayled.  Gir .j. ca .vij. Brytayn was somtyme occupyed with Saxons / & peas was made & stablisshed with y• Pictes / than y• Scottes y• came with the Pictes sawe y• the Pictes were nobler of dedes and better men of armes though they were lesse in nombre than y• Scottes. Than the Scottes hauynge therof enuy turned to theyr natural treason y• they haue ofte vsed. For in treason they passe other men / & be¯ traytours as it were by kynde / for they prayed all the Pictes / & specially the gretest of them to a feest / & wayted theyr tyme whan the Pictes were mery and had well dronke they drewe vp nayles y• helde vp holowe benches vnder the Pictes / & the Pictes vnware sodeynly fell in ouer y• hammes in to a wonderfull pytfall. Than y• Scottes fell on y• Pictes & slewe them / & lefte none alyue. And so of two maner people the better warryours were al destroyed But the other that ben y• Scottes whiche ben traytours all vnlyke to y• Pictes toke {pro}fyte by that fals treason / for they toke all that londe / and holde it yet vnto this tyme / & call it Scotlo¯de after theyr owne name. In kynge Edgarus tyme Kynadius Alpinus sone was duke &  der of the Scottes / and warred in Picte londe & destroyed the Pictes. He warred syxe tymes in Saxon / & toke all y• londe that is bytwene Twede & y• Scottysshe see with wronge & with strength.  Of the languages / of maners & vsage of the people of that londe. Ca .xv. AS it is knowen how many maner of people ben in this ylonde there ben also so many languages and tongues. Neuertheles W n and Scottes that ben not medled with other nacyons kepe yet theyr language & speche. But yet y• Scottes that were somtyme confederate and dwelled with Pictes drawe somwhat after theyr speche.   But the Flemynges y• dwell in the west syde of Wales haue lefte theyr straunge speche & speke lyke to saxons. Also Englysshmen though they had fro y• begynnynge thre maner of speches / southerne northerne / & myddle speche in y• myddle of the londe / as they come of thre maner of people of Germania. Neuertheles by commixcyon & medlynge fyrst wt Danes & afterward wt Normans / in many thynges y• coumtree language is appayred / for some vse straumge wlaffynge / chyteryng harryng / garryng & grysbytyng. This appayring of y• language cometh of two thynges. One bycause y• children y• go to scole lerne to speke fyrst englysshe / & than ben compelled to construe theyr lessons in frensshe / & that hath be¯ vsed syth y• Normans came in to Englonde. Also gentylmens children ben lerned & taught from theyr youth to speke Frensshe / & vplondisshmen wyll coumterfeyte & lyken them selfe to gentylmen / and are besy to speke frensshe for to be more set by / wherfore it is sayd by a comyn {pro}uerbe. Iacke wold be a gentylma¯ yf he coude speke frensshe  Treuisa. This was moche vsed tofore the grete deth / but syth it is somdele chaunged / for syr Iohn Cornewayle a mayster of gra¯mer chaumged y• techynge of gra¯mer scole & co¯struccyon of frensshe in to englysshe. And other scole maysters vse y• same waye now / in the yere of our lord. M .CCC .lxxxv. the .ix. yere of king Rychard y• seconde / & leue all frensshe in scoles & vse all construccyon in englysshe wherin they haue auaumtage one waye / that is y• they lerne the sooner theyr gra¯mer / & in an other disauaumtage / for now they lerne no frensshe / nor can none / whiche is hurte to them y• shall passe the see. And also gentylmen haue moche lefte to teche theyr chyldren to speke Frensshe.  R. It semeth a grete wonder y• Englysshmen haue so grete diuersite in theyr owne language in sowne & in speking of it / whiche is all in one ylonde. And y• language of Normandy is comen out of an other londe / & hath one maner sowne amonge all other y• speke it in Englonde / for a man of kent / southerne / westerne & northerne men speke frensshe all lyke in sowne & speche / but they can not speke theyr englisshe so.  Treuisa. Neuerthelesse there ben as many diuers maner of frensshe in the realme of Fraumce / as dyuers englysshe in y• realme of Englonde.  R. Also of the foresayd tongue whiche is departed in thre is grete wonder / for men of y• eest with men of y• west accorde better in sownynge of theyr speche than men of y• north wt men of y• south. Therfore it is y• men of merc  y• ben of myddle Englonde as it were partyners with y• endes / vnderstande better the syde languages northerne & southerne than northerne & southerne vnderstande eyther other.  Wilhel. de pon .li.  . All y• language of the northumbres & specially at Yorke is so sharpe shyteynge / fro yng & vnshappe / y• we southerne men may vnneth vndersta¯de y• language. I suppose the cause be y• they be nigh to y• alyens y• speke straumgely. Also y• kynges of Englonde abyde & dwell more in y• south coumtree than in y• north coumtree / bycause there is better corne londe / more people / more noble citees / & more {pro}fytable hauens in the south coumtre than in y• north coumtre.  De gentis huius moribus. Gir. in  ere. FOr y• maners & doynge of walssh men & of Scottes ben tofore somwhat declared. Now I purpose to tell & declare y• condicyons of y• myddle people of Englonde. But the Flemynges y• ben in y• west syde of Wales ben now all turned as they were Englisshmen / bycause they company with Englysshmen. And   they be myghty & stronge to fyght / and ben the moost enemyes that Walshmen haue / and vse marcha dyse & clothynge & ben full redy to put themselfe in auentures & to peryll in y• see & londe bycause of grete wynnyng / & ben redy somtyme to the plowe / & somtyme to dedes of armes whan tyme and place a eth. It semeth of these men a grete wonder y• in a bone of a wethers ryght sholder whan the flesshe is soden away and not rosted they knowe what hath be done / is done and shall be done / as it were by spiryte of propheeye & wonderfull crafte. They tell what is done in ferre countrees / tokens of peas or of warre / the state of the realme / sleynge of men & spousebreche / suche thynges they declare  rtayne of tokens & sygnes that is in suche a sholder bone.  R. But the Englysshmen y• dwel in Englo¯de ben medled in y• ylonde and ben ferre from the places that they spronge of fyrst turne to the contrary dedes lyghtly without entycynge of ony other men by theyr owne assent. And vn easy also vnpacient of peas / enemyes of besynes / and full of slouth.  Wilhel. de pon .li .iij. sayth. That whan they haue destroyed theyr enemyes all to y• groumde than they fyght with themselfe and slee eche other / as a voyde and an empty sto mak werketh in it selfe.  R. Neuerthel sse men of the south ben easyer & more mylde than men of y• north. For they be more vnstable / more cruell / and more vn easy. The myddle men ben parteners wt bothe. Also they vse them to glotony more than other men / & ben more costlewe in meet & clothynge. Men suppose that they toke yt vyce of kynge Hardyknoght that was a Dane. For he badde set forth  wyes double messe at dyner & at souper also. These men ben spedefull on hors & a fote / able & redy to all maner dedes of  s / & ben wont to haue vyctory and maystry in euery fyght where no treason is walkyng / and ben curyous & can well tell dedes & wonders that they haue seen. And they go in dyuers londes / vnneth ben ony men ryche in theyr owne londe or more gracyous in ferre and in straumge londe / they can better wynne & gete newe than kepe theyr owne herytage. Therfore it is that they be spradde so wyde / & wene y• euery londe is theyr owne. The men ben able to all maner of sleyght & wytte / but tofore y• dede blonderynge & hasty / & more wyse after the dede than tofore / & leue of lyghtly what they haue begon.  Solin{us} li .vj. Therfore Eugenius the pope sayd / that Englysshmen were able to do what euer they wolde / & to be set & put tofore all other / ne were yt lyght wytte letteth. And as Hanyball sayd that y• Romayns myght not be ouercomen but in theyr own coumtre so Englysshmen may not be ouercomen in straumge londes / but in theyr owne coumtre they be lyghtly ouercomen.  R. These men despyse theyr owne & prayse other men / & vnneth be pleased wt theyr owne estate / what befalleth other men yt they wyll gladly take to themselfe. Therfore it is yt a yeman arayeth him as a squyer a squyer as a knyght / a knight as a duke / a duke as a kyng. Yet some go about & wyll be lyke to all maner state & be in no state / for they take euery degre yt be of no degre / for in beryng outward they be min strels & herawdes / in talkyng grete spekers / in etyng & dry¯kyng glotons / in gaderyng of catell hucksters & tauerners / in araye turmentours / in wynnynges Argi / in trauayle Tan ali / in takynge hede Dedali / in beddes Sardanapali / in chirches mawmets / in courtes thondre onely / in {per}uylege of clergy & in prebe¯des they knowlege themself clerkes.  Treuisa. As touchyng y• termes of latyn / as Argi / Ta¯tali / Dedali / Sardinapali / ye   must vnderstande them as y• poetes feyned of them. Argus was an herde and kepte beestes / he had an hondred eyen / & Argus was also a shyppe / a shipman / & a chapman / & so Argus myght se before and behynde & on euery syde. Therfore he that is wyse & ware & can se that he be not deceyued / may be called Argus. And so the cronycle sayth in plurell nombre y• Englysshmen ben Argi / that is to saye / they se about where as wynnyng is. That other worde Tantali / the poete feyneth that Tantalus slewe his owne sone / wherfore he is dampned to perpetuall penaumce / and he standeth alwaye in water vp to the nether lyppe / & hath alwaye rype apples & noble fruyte hangynge downe to the ouer lyppe. But the fruyte nor the water may not come wtin his mouth. He is so holden & sta¯deth bytwene meet & drynke / and may neyther ete nor drynke / & is euer an hongred and a thyrst / that woo is hym alyue by this maner lykenes of Tantalus / they that do right nought there as is moche to do in euery syde ben called Tantali. It semeth that it is to say in trauayle they be Tantali / for they do ryght nought therto. The thyrde worde is Dedali / take hede that Dedalus was a subtyll and a slye man. And therfore by lykenes they that ben subtyll and slye / they ben called Dedali. And the fourth worde is Sardanapali / ye shall vndersta¯de yt Sardanapalus was kynge of Assyryens / and was full vnchaste / & vsed hym for to lye softe. And by a maner of lykenes of hym they that lyue vnchastly be¯ called Sardanapali.  R. But amo¯ge all Englysshmen medled togyders is so grete a chaumgynge & diuersite of clothynge & of aray and so many maners & dyuers shappes that well nygh is there ony ma¯ knowen by his clothynge and his araye of what someuer degree that he be. Therof prophecyed an holy Anker in  ynge Egelfredes tyme in this maner. Hen i .li .vj. Englysshmen for as moche as they vse them to dronklewnes / to treason / & to rechelesnes of goddes  ous / fyrst by Danes / & than by Normans / & at y• thyrde tyme by y• Scottes that they holde the moost wretchest and leest worth of all other they shall be ouercomen. Than the worlde shall be so vnstable & so d uers & varyable that y• vnstablenes of thoughtes shall be betokened by many maner dyuersytees of clothynge.

And one of y• wardeyns y• kepte the body of saint Andrewe in Constantinople was warned in his slepe y• he shold go in to a place whyder an aumgell  wold  lede hy¯ / & so he came in to Scotlonde with .vij. felowes to the toppe of an hyll named Ragmont. The same houre lyght of heuen beshone & be cleped y• king of Pictes y• was comynge wt his hoost to a place called Carceuan. There anone were heled many seke men. There mette wt the kynge Regulus the monke of Constantynople with the rely kes of saynt Andrewe.

Of welues & ryght shrewed myte / there ben attercoppes / blode soukers / eeftes y• do n  harme / there ben fayres lytell of body & ful hardy & stronge / there ben batnacles foules lyke wylde gees / whiche grewe wondersly vpon trees / as it were nature wrought agaynst kynde. Men of relygyon ete barnacles vpon fastyng dares bycause they be not engendred wt flesshe wherin as me thy¯keth they erre / for  ason is agaynst y• / for yf a man had eten of Adams legge he had ete¯ flesshe / & yet Ada¯ was not engendred of fader nor moder / but y• flesshe cometh wondersly of y• tree. In this lo¯de is plente of hony & of mylke of vine & of vyneyerdes.  Solin{us} & ys d wryte y• Irlo¯de hath no bees. Neuerthelesse it were better wryten y• Irlo¯de had bees & no vyneyerdes.  Be a sayth y• there is grete humtyng to roobuckes / & it is knowen y• there be none. It is no wonder of Beda / for he neuer sawe y• londe /    but some man tolde hy¯ suche tales. Also there groweth that stone Saxagon{us} / & is called Iris also / as it were the rayne bowe / yf that stone be holden agaynst y• sonne / anone it shall shape a raynbowe. There is also founden a stone y• is called Gagathes / & whyte margery perles.  Of the defaute of the londe. Ca .xxv. Hete cornes ben there full small vnneth clensed wt ma¯nes hande reserued men / all beestes be¯ smaller there than in other lo¯des. There lacketh well nygh al maner fresshe water fysshe y• is not gendred in the see. There lacketh vnkynde faucons / gerfaucons / pertryche / fesaumt / nyghtyngales and pyes. There lacketh also Roo & Bucke / & Ilespyles / wontes / and other venymous beestes. Therfore some men feyne & that fauourably y• saynt Patryck clensed y• londe of wormes & of venymous beestes. But it is more probable & skylfull y• this londe was from y• begynnynge alwaye wtout suche wormes / for venymous beestes & wormes dye there anone yf men brynge them thyder out of other lo¯des. Also venym and poyson brought thyder out of other londes / lese theyr malyce as soone as it passeth the myddle of the see. Also poudre & erth of that londe cast & sowen in other londes dryue away wormes / so ferforth that yf a turfe of y• londe be put about a worme it sleeth hym or maketh hym thryll that erth for to escape away. In that londe cockes crowe but lytell tofore daye / so that the fyrst crowynge of cockes in that londe & the thirde in other londes ben lyke ferre tofore the daye.  Of them that fyrst enhabyted Irlonde. Ca .xxvj. GIrald{us} sayth that Casera Noes nece drad the flode & fledde wt thre men & fyfty women in to that ylonde / & dwelled therin fyrst the last yere tofore Noes flode. But afterwarde Bartholanus Seres sone that came of Iaphet Noes sone came thider wt his thre sones by happe or by crafte .CCC. yere after Noes flode / & dwelled there & encreaced to y• nombre of .ix. M. men / & afterward for stenche of careyns of gyaumtes y• they had slayne / they dyed all saue one Ruanus that lyued. M .v .C. yere vnto saynt Patrykes tyme / & enformed y• holy man of the foresayd men / & of all the doynges and dedes. Than the thyrde tyme came thyder Nimeth out of Scicia wt his. iiij sones / and dwelled there .CC .xvj. yere. And at y• last of his ofsprynge by dyuers my shappes of warre & of moreyne they were clene destroyed and the londe lefte voyde .CC. yere after. The fourth tyme v. dukes that were bretherne Gandius Genandus / Saga¯dius / Rutheragus & Slauius / of the sayd Nimethes successours came out of Grece & occupied that lo¯de & deled it in .v. partyes / & euery partye co¯teyneth .xxij. candredes. A ca¯drede is a coumtree y• conteyneth an .C. townes / & they set a stone in the myddle of y• lond as it were in the nauell and begynnyng of .v. kyngdomes. At the last Slauius was made kyng of all y• lond. The fyfth tyme whan this nacyon was .xxx. yere togyder they wexed feble. Foure noble men that were Millesius y• ky¯ges sones came out of Spayne wt many other in a nauy of .xl. shyppes / & .ij. of y• worthyest of these .iiij. bretherne y• hyght Hyber{us} & Hermon deled y• lo¯de bytwene them two But afterward couenaumt was broken bytwene them bothe & Hyber{us} was slayne Than Hermon was kyng of all y• londe. And from his tyme to y• fyrst Patrykes tyme were kynges of y• nacyon .C .xxxi. And so fro y• comynge of Hibernensis vnto y• fyrst Patryk were. M. viij .C. yere.   They had that name Hibernensis & Hibernia of y• foresayd Hiberus / or els of Hibet{us} a ryuer of Spayne. They were called also Gatels & Scottes of one Gaytelus y• was Phenis neuewe. This Gaytelus coude speke many languages after the languages that were made at Nemproths Toure / and wedded one Scotta Pharoes doughter. Of these dukes came y• Hiberne¯sis. Men saye y• this Gaytelus made y• Irysshe language / & called it Gaytelaf / as it were a language gadred of all languages & tongues. At the last Belinus kyng of Britayn had a sone and hyght Gurgumcius that came out of Denmarke / at the ylondes Orcades he foumde men that were called Basclensis / and were comen thyder out of Spayne / these men prayed & besought to haue a place to dwell in. And y• kyng sent them to Irlonde that was tho voyde & waste & ordeyned & sent wt them dukes & capytayns of his own. And so it semeth y• It londe  shold  longe to Brytayne by ryght of olde tyme. From y• fyrst saynt Patryk vnto Fedliundius y• kynges tyme .cccc. yere regned .xxxiij. kynges eueryche after other in Irlonde. In this Fedliundi{us} tyme Turgesius duke and capytayne of Norway brought thyder men of Norway & occupyed y• lond / & made in many places depe dyches and castels / sengle / double & treble / & many wardes strongly walled / & many of them stande yet all hole / but the Irysshmen retche not of castels / for they take woodes for castels / & marays & mores for castell dyches. But at y• last Turgesius dyed by gylefulnes of women. And Englysshmen saye that Gurmumdus wan Irlonde & made those dyches / & made no mencyon of Turgesius. And Irysshmen speke of Turge {us} & knowe not of Gurmumdus. Therfore it is to wyte that Gurmumdus had wonne Brytayn & dwelled therin / & sent Turgesius with grete strengthe in to Irlonde for to wynne y• londe / & bycause Turgesius was capytayne & leder of y• v age & iourney and seen amonge them / therfore Irysshmen speke moche of hy¯ as a noble man y• was seen in y• londe & knowen. At the last wham Gurmumdus was slayne in Fraumce Turges {us} loued y• kynges doughter of Irlonde / & her fader behyght Turgesius y• he wolde sende he  hy¯ to y• lowe latheri  with .xv. maydens / & Turgesi{us} promised to mete there wt .xv. of ye noblest men yt he had: & held couenaumt & thought no gyle / but there came .xv. yonge berdles men clothed lyke women with shorte swerdes vnder theyr clothes / and fell on Turgesi{us} & slewe hym ryght there / & so he was traytoursly slayne after he had regned .xxx. yere. Not lo¯ge after thre bretherne / Amelanus / S tacus & Iuo us came in to Irlo¯de with theyr men out of Norway as it had ben for loue of peas & of marchaumdyse / & dwelled by ye see syde by assent of Irysshmen yt were alwaye ydle as Paules knyghtes / and the Norways buylded thre citees / Deuelin waterford & Lymerych / & encreased & after wexed rebell agaynst men of that londe & brought fyrst sparthes in to Irlonde. So fro Turgesi{us} tyme vnto Roderykes tyme kyng of Connatia yt was the last yt was kyng of all y• londe were .xvii. kynges in Irlo¯de / & so ye kynges yt regned in Irlonde from the Hermons tyme vnto the last Roderykes tyme were in all .C. l  kynges that were not crowned neyther enoynted / n  by lawe of herytage / but by myght / maistry and strength of armes. The seconde Henry kynge of Englonde made this Roderyke subgect the yere of kynge Henryes age .xl. and of his regne xviij. the yere of our lorde. xj .C .lxxij.  Of the condycyons and maners of Irlonde. Ca .xxvij.  SOlinus sayth yt men of this londe ben straunge of nacyon / houseles and grete fighters / and account ryght & wronge all one thynge / & ben syngle of clothynge / scarse of meet / cruell of herte / angry of speche / & drinketh fyrst blode of deed men that ben slayne / & than wasshe theyr visages therwith / and holde them payed with flesshe and fruyte in stede of meet / & with mylke in stede of drynke / & vse moche playenge & ydlenes and huntynge / and trauayle but lytell. In theyr chyldhode they ben harde nourysshed & harde fedde / & they ben vnsemely of maners & of clothynge / & haue breche & hosen alone of wolle / & strayte hodes that stretcheth a cubyte ouer the sholders behynde / and foldy¯ges in stede of mantels & of clokes. Also they vse no sadels / bootes ne spurres whan they ryde / but they dryue theyr horses wt a chambred yerde in the ouer ende. In stede of byttes with trenches and of brydels of reest / they vse brydels that lette not theyr horses to ete theyr meet / they fyght vnarmed naked in body / neuertheles with two dartes & speres / and with brode sparthes they fyght wt one hande. These men forsake tyllynge of londe / and kepe pasture for beestes. They vse longe berdes & longe lockes hangynge downe behynde theyr hedes / they vse no crafte of flaxe / of woll of metall / nor of marchaumdyse / but gyue them to ydlenes & to slouth / & reken rest for lykynge / and for fredome for rychesse And though Scotlonde the doughter of Irlonde vse harpe / tymbre / and tabour. Neuertheles Irysshe men be connynge in two maner instrumentes of musyke / in harpe and tymbre yt is armed wt wyre and strenges of brasse / on whiche instrumentes though they playe hastely and swyftly they make ryght mery armony & melody with thycke tewnes / werbles and notes / and begyn from bemoll / and playe secretly vnder dyme sowne on the grete strenges / and turne agayne vnto the same / so that the gretest party of the crafte hydeth the craft as it wolde seme as though the crafte so hydde sholde be ashamed yf it were take. These men ben of euyll maners in theyr lyuynge / they paye no tythynges / they wedde lawfully / they spare not theyr alyes / but y• broder weddeth the broders wyfe / they ben besy to betraye theyr neyghbours / and other they bere sparthes in theyr ha¯des in stede of staues / & fyght agaynst them that trust moost to them / these men ben varyable & vnstedfast / trechours & gylefull / who that deleth with them nedeth more to beware of gyle than of crafte / of peas than of bre¯nynge brondes / of hony than of gall / of malyce than of knyghthode / they haue suche maners yt they be not stronge in warre & in batayle / ne true in peas / they become gosseps to them yt they wyll falsly betraye in ye gosseprede & holy kynrede / eueryche drynketh others blode whan it is shedde / they loue somdele theyr nouryce and theyr playferes whiche that souke ye same mylke yt they souked wham they were chyldren / & they pursue theyr bretherne / theyr cosyns / & theyr other kynne / & despise theyr kynne whyles they lyue / & auenge theyr deth whan they ben slayne. So longe hath y• vsage of euyll custome endured amonge them / that it hath goten ye maystry ouer them / & turneth treason in to kynde / so ferforth yt they ben traytours by nature. And alyens and men of straumge londes yt dwell amo¯ge them folowynge theyr maners that vnneth there is none but he is besmetted wt theyr treason also. Amonge them many men pysse syttynge / and women standynge.  There ben many men in that londe foule shapen in lymmes & in body / for in theyr lymmes they lacke the benefyce of kynde. So that no   where  better shapen than they that ben there wel shapen    worse shapen than they y• ben  yll shapen. And skylfully nature hurt & defouled by wyt   of lyuynge bryngeth suche foul gro es & euyll shape of them that wt vn  full de ynge wt foule maners & euyll lyuyng so wyckedly defouleth kynde &  .  In this londe & in Wales olde wyues & women were wonte & ben yet as men saye ofte for to shape themself in lykenes of hares to mylke theyr neyghbours kyen & stele theyr mylke / and ofte greyhoumdes tenne after them & pursue them / & wene that they he hares. And some by crafte of nygroma¯cy make fatte swyne for to be reed of colour / & sell them in markettes & fayres. But as soone as these swyne passe ony water they turne in to theyr owne kynde / whether it be strawe / hey / grasse / or turues. But these swyne may not be kepte by no crafte for to endute in lykenes of swyne ouer thre days. Amo¯ge these wo¯dets & other take hede that in y• vttermest ende of y•  world  falleth newe meruayles & wonders / as though ky¯de played wt large loue secretly & ferre in y• endes / than openly  nygh in the myddel / therfore in this ylonde be many grysely wonders & meruayles.  Of the meruayles and wonders of Irlonde. Ca .xxviij. MAny men tell that in y• north syde of Irlonde is y• londe of lyfe. In that ylonde no man may dye / but whan they be olde & vexed with grete sekenes they be borne out in to the nexte londe / & there dye.  There is another ylonde in Irlonde y• no woman therin may  e e a chylde / but yet she may co¯ceyue.  Also there is an ylonde in whiche no deed body may rotte. In Vltonia y• is  lster is an yl de that a  uke wonderly departeth in twayne. In y• one parte is grete distur baunce   discomforte of fr des / & in that other party grete lykynge & comforte of holy aungels. There is also sayne Patrykes purgatory / that was shewed at his prayer to conferme his prechynge & his  ore whan he preched to mysbyleued men of sorowe & payne y• euyll men shold suffre for theyr euyll werkes / & of ioye & of blysse that good men shall receyue for theyr holy dedes. He telleth that who y• suffreth y• paynes of purgatory (yf it be enioyned hym for penaumce) he shal neuer suffre the paynes of hell / but he dye fynally wtout tepentaumce of synne / as ye ensample is set more ful at the ende of this chap te.  Treuisa. But truly no man may be saued but yf he be very repentaumt what someuer penaunce he do / & euery man that is very repentaumt at his lyues ende shal be sekerly saued / though he neuer here of saynt Patrykes purgatory. There is an ylonde in Connacte Sa  / y• is in y• see of Conaccina halowed by say¯  Brandon / y• hath no myce / there deed bodyes ben not buryed / but be¯ kepte out of the erth & rotte not. In Mamoma is a welle / who y• wassheth hym wt the waterof y• welle / he shall were hoore on his heed. There is an other well in Vltonia who someuer is wasshen therin he shall neuer wexe hoore afterwarde. There is a welle in Moumstre or Mamoma / yf  ny man touche y• well / anone shall fall grete rayne in all that prouynce / & that rayne shall neuer cesse tyll a preest y• is a  ne mayden synge a masse in a chapell that is fast by & blysse y• water / & with mylke of a   that is of one yere besprynge y• welle / and so reconcyle the welle in this straunge maner. At Glyndal an aboute the oratory of saynt Keywyn wytches bere apples as it were apple trees / and ben more holsome than sauery. That holy sayne brought forth these apples by prayers for to   his childe y• was seke   There is a lake in  lster & moche fysshe therin whiche is .xxx. myle in length / & xv. in brede. The ryuer Ban renneth out of that lake in to y• north Occean / & men saye that this lake began in this maner. There were men in yt countree yt were of euyll lyuynge (coeuntes cum Brutis) And there was a welle in y• londe in grete reuerence of olde tyme / & alwaye couered / yf it were lefte vncouered / the well wold ryse & drowne all y• londe. And so it happed that a woman went to yt welle for to fetche water: & hyed her fast to her childe that wepte in the cradell / & lefte y• welle vncouered / than ye welle sprange so fast that it drowned ye woman & her chylde / and made all the coumtree a lake & a fysshe ponde. For to preue ye this is sothe it is a grete argument / that whan ye weder is clere / fysshers of yt water se in y• grounde vnder the water rounde toures & hygh shapen as steples & chirches of y• londe. In the north syde of Irlonde in the coumtree of Ossyryens euery .vij. yere at the prayer of an holy abbot / twayne that be¯ wedded a man & a woman must nedes be exyled and forshapen in to lykenes of wolues / & abyde out .vij. yere. And at y• ende of .vij. yere yf they lyue they come home agayne & take agayn theyr owne shape / and than shall other twayne go forth in theyr stede / and so forshapen for other .vij. yere. There is a lake in this londe / yf a poole of tree pyght & stycked therin / that parte of the shafte or poole yt is in the erth shall turne in to yren / and that parte y• abydeth in the water shall turne in to stone / and that parte that abydeth aboue shall be tree in his owne kynde. Also there is a lake that turneth h sell in to asshe / and asshe in to hasel / yf it be done therin. Also in Irlonde be¯ thre   lepes / there as samons lepe a st a roche a longe speres lengthe.   Leg  is a pond there ben seen Colmans byrdes / the byrdes called Certelles / and come homely to   hande / but yf men do them wroug  or harme / they go away & come not agayn and the water there shall be bytter and stynke / & he that dyd y• wronge shall not astert without wreche & myschefe / but yf he do amendes.   . As touchynge saynt Patrykes purgatory / ye shall vnderstande that y• seconde saynt Patryke that was abbot & not bysshop whyle he preched in Irlonde / laboured & studyen for to turne thylke wycked men y• lyued as beestes out of theyr euyl lyfe for drede of y• paynes of h ll / & for to co¯ferme them to good lyf. And they sayd they wold not turne but some of them myght knowe som what of the grete paynes & also of y• blysse that he spake of. Than saynt Patryke prayed to almyghty god therfore / & our lord Iesu Chryst appered to saynt Patryke / & toke hym a staffe & ladde hy¯ in to a wylde place & shewed hym there a rounde pyt y• was derke within & sayd / that yf a man were very repentaumt & stable in byleue & went in to this pyt & walked therin a daye & a nyght / he sholde se the sorowes & the paynes of euyl men / & the Ioye and blysse of good men. Than Chryst vanisshed out of Patrikes syght And saynt Patryke arered and buylded there a chirche / and put therin chanons reguler / & closed the pyt aboute with a wall / & is now in the chirche yerde at the eest ende of the chirche / & fast shette with a stronge dore / for no man sholde nycely go in without leue of the bysshop / or of the pryour of y• place. Many men went in and came out agayne in saynt Patrykes tyme / & tolde of paynes & Ioye that they had seen / and the meruayles that they sawe ben there yet wryten / and bycause therof many men turned & were conuerted to ryght byleue. Also many men went in & came neuer out agayne.   In kyng Stephens tyme kyng of Englonde / a knyght y• hyght Owayne went in to saynt Patrykes purgatory & came agayn / & dwelled euer after duryng his lyfe in the nedes of the abbey of Ludensis that is of y• ordre of Cysteaux / & tolde many wonders that he had seen in Patrykes purgatory. That place is called Patrykes purgatory / and the chirche is named Reglis. No man is enioyned for to go in to that purgatory / but coumseyled that he sholde not come therin / but take vpon hym other penaumce. And yf a man haue auoided & be saable and wyl nedes go therin / he shall fyrst go to the bysshop and than he shall be sent with lettres to the pryoue of y• place / & they bothe shall coumseyle hym to leue. And yf he wyll nedes go therto / he shall be in prayers & in fastynge .xv. dayes / and after .xv. dayes he shall be houseled & ladde to the dore of the purgatory with processyon & letany and yet he shall be coumseyled to leue it / & yf he be stedfast and wyll en e / the dore shall be opened & he blyssed & go in goddes name / & holde forth his waye / and the dore shall be fast shette tyll the nexte daye / and whan the tyme is the pryour shall come and open the dore / and yf the man be comen he ledeth hym in to y• chirche with {pro}cessyon / and there he shall be xv. dayes in prayers and fastynge.  Of the meruayles of sayntes of Irlonde. Ca .xxix. HEre Girald{us} maketh mynde that as men of this nacyon ben more angry than other men / & more hasty for to take wreche whyles they ben alyue / so sayntes & halowes of this londe ben more wrechefull than sayntes of other londes. Clerkes of this londe ben chaste and saye many prayers / & done grete abstynence a daye / & drynke al nyght / so is accounted for a myracle y•  ery  th not there as wyne regneth / and ben chasen out of abbeys in to the clergy / & done as monkes sholde. But they y• ben  yll of them ben worste of all other. So good men amonge them though they ben but fewe ben good at ye best. Prelates of that countree ben full  owe in cor  o  trespace / and besy in co¯templacyon / and not in prechyng of goddes worde. Therfore it is that all y• sayntes of that londe ben co¯fessours and no martyrs amonge them / & no wonder / for al the prelates of this londe clerkes and prelates sholde do is to them vnknowen. Therfore wham   was put agaynst the bysshop of Cassyll how it myght be that so many sayntes ben in Irlonde & neuer a martyr amo¯ge them all / sythen y• the men be¯ so shrewed and so angry / & the prelates so recheles and slowe in cor eccyon of trespace. The bysshop answered frowardly ynough & sayd. Our men ben shrewed and angry ynough to themselfe / but to goddes seruaumtes they ley neuer ha¯de / but do them grete reuerence & worshyp / but englyssh men come in to this londe that can make martyrs / & were wont to vse that crafte   . The bisshop sayd so bycause y• kyng Henry the seconde was tho newe comen in to Irlonde fresshely after the marty  dome of saynt Thomas of Caumterbury.  Gir. In this londe / in wales & in   londe ben belles and staues with croked hedes / & other suche thy¯ges for retykes in grete reuerence & worship / so y• men of this londe drede more for to swere vpon one of those belles & golden staues than vpon the gospels. The chefe of all suche relykes is holden Iesus staffe that is a  Deuelyn / with y• whiche staffe they say that y• fyrst saynt Patryke droue y• wormes out of Irlond.  Aug{us}. de ci. dei ca .vij. yf men a e how it may be y• dyuers maner of beestes & of dyuers kynde that     kyndly goten bytwene male & female come   ben in ylondes after Noes flode. Men suppose that suche beestes  wa¯me in to ylondes about  / & fyrst to the nexte and  o forth in to other. Or els men saylynge in to ylondes brought with them suche beestes for loue of huntynge. Or aungels at god almyghtyes camaunde ment brought suche beestes in to ylondes aboute / or the erth brought them forth fyrst / and fulfylled tho goddes commaundement / that commaumded y• erth to brynge forth grasse and quycke beestes.  Here endeth the descripcyon of Brytayne / the whiche conteyneth Englonde Wales and Scotlond / and also bycause Irloude is vnder the  ule of Englonde / & of olde tyme it  ath so contynued / ther fore I haue set the descripcyon of y• same after the sayd Brytayn / whiche I haue taken out of  cronycon. And bycause it is necessary vnto all Englysshemen to knowe y• propertees /  modytees & meruayles of them / I  illyam Caxton haue set them fyrst in imprynt accordynge to the translacyon of Treuisa / whiche at y• request of the lorde Barkeley translated y• boke of Polyeronycon in to Englysshe.
